## All sagelib-building is done by setup.py.
## This is so that sagelib can be installed by standard Python procedures,
## such as "./setup.py install" or "pip install ."
## BECAUSE OF THIS, DON'T ADD ADDITIONAL STEPS TO THIS MAKEFILE.

## We poison all environment variables that have paths to the sage source and build directories,
## but keep the directories below SAGE_LOCAL intact.
## In this way we make sure that all of the sagelib build's source paths are communicated through
## the current directory (for the source tree).
## Building takes places in the build/ subdirectory.
## The environment variable SAGE_CYTHONIZED needs to point to build/cythonized.
##
## As a special exception, we feed SAGE_PKGS.  This is needed by src/sage_setup/optional_extension.py
## via src/sage/misc/package.py.  Hoping that #20382 will make this unnecessary.
##
## TODO: Do also something about the SAGE_LOCAL stuff:
##  - some of it (our install) should be communicated only through --install-base;
##  - others (installed packages that we pull in) through some configuration mechanism.
##
## TODO: Currently providing --install-base=$(SAGE_LOCAL) leads to this error:
## [sagelib-7.4.beta4] running install
## [sagelib-7.4.beta4] error: install-base or install-platbase supplied, but installation scheme is incomplete
