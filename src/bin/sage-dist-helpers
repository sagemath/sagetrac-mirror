# Shell functions for making spkg-install scripts a little easier to write,
# eliminating duplication.  All Sage helper functions begin with sdh_ (for
# Sage-distribution helper).  Consult the below documentation for the list of
# available helper functions:
#
# - sdh_die MESSAGE
#
#    If the last command run exited with an error, exit the build script
#    with the error code of the last command, and print an error message.
#    Typically used like:
#
#        command || sdh_die "Command failed"
#
# - sdh_check_vars [VARIABLE ...]
#
#    Check that one or more variables are defined and non-empty, and exit with
#    an error if any are undefined or empty. Variable names should be given
#    without the '$' to prevent unwanted expansion.
#
# - sdh_guard
#
#    Wrapper for `sdh_check_vars` that checks some common variables without
#    which many/most packages won't build correctly (SAGE_ROOT, SAGE_LOCAL,
#    SAGE_SHARE). This is important to prevent installation to unintended
#    locations.
#
# - sdh_configure [...]
#
#    Runs `./configure --prefix="$SAGE_LOCAL"`.  Additional arguments to
#    `./configure` may be given as arguments.
#
# - sdh_make [...]
#
#    Runs `$MAKE` with the default target.  Additional arguments to `make` may
#    be given as arguments.
#
# - sdh_make_install [...]
#
#    Runs `$SAGE_SUDO $MAKE install`.  Additional arguments to `make` may be
#    given as arguments.
#
# - sdh_pip_install [...]
#
#    Runs `pip install` with the given arguments, as well as additional
#    default arguments used for installing packages into Sage with pip.
#    Currently this is just a wrapper around the `sage-pip-install` command.
