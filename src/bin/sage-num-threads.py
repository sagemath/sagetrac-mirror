# Determine the number of threads to be used by Sage.
# This is a simplified version of SAGE_ROOT/build/bin/sage-build-num-threads.py
#
# Outputs three space-separated numbers:
# 1) The number of threads to use for Sage, based on MAKE, MAKEFLAGS
#    and SAGE_NUM_THREADS
# 2) The number of threads to use when parallel execution is explicitly
#    asked for (e.g. sage -tp)
# 3) The number of CPU cores in the system, as determined by
#    multiprocessing.cpu_count()
