Visualization
=============

One of the most common uses of computer algebra systems is of course
plotting.  At the moment Sage does not have much in the way of
intrinsic support for visualization. However, there are some very
powerful open source programs for visualization that you can use from
within Sage. The goal of this chapter is to explain how to set them
up.  The main tool we will be using is VTK, http://www.vtk.org. VTK is
an amazing visualization tool, and the results that can be achieved
are incredible. It is probably one of the best visualization tools in
existence, and can probably do anything you might want a visualization
tool to do. However, because it can do so much, it is a bit tricky to
use potentially. Luckily there are a few tools for using VTK from
within python that make it easier to get started.  The ones we will
focus on are MavaVi, http://mayavi.sourceforge.net/, and easyviz.
