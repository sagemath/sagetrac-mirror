Weave
=====

Weave is a tool that does for C/C++ what f2py does for fortran
(though we should note it is also possible to wrap C code using
f2py). Suppose we have some data stored in numpy arrays and we want
to write some C/C++ code to do something with that data that needs
to be fast. For a trivial example, let us write a function that
sums the contents of a numpy array

::

    sage: from scipy import weave
    sage: from scipy.weave import converters

::

    def my_sum(a):
        n=int(len(a))
        code="""
        int i;
        long int counter;
        counter =0;
        for(i=0;i<n;i++)
        {
            counter=counter+a(i);
        }
        return_val=counter;
        """

        err=weave.inline(code,['a','n'],type_converters=converters.blitz,compiler='gcc')
        return err

To call this function do ::

    import numpy
    a = numpy.array(range(60000))
    time my_sum(a)
    time sum(range(60000))

The first time the weave code executes the code is compiled, from
then on, the execution is immediate. You should find that python's
built-in sum function is comparable in speed to what we just wrote.
Let us explain some things about this example. As you can see, to
use weave you create a string containing pure C/C++ code. Then you
call weave.inline on it. You pass to weave the string with the
code, as well as a list of python object that it is to
automatically convert to C variables. So in our case we can refer
to the python objects :math:`a` and :math:`n` inside of weave.
Numpy arrays are accessed by :math:`a(i)` if they are
one-dimensional or :math:`a(i,j)` if they are two dimensional. Of
course we cannot use just any python object, currently weave knows
about all python numerical data types such as ints and floats, as
well as numpy arrays. Note that numpy arrays do not become pointers
in the C code (which is why they are accessed by ( ) and not [ ].
If you need a pointer you should copy the data into a pointer. Next
is a more complicated example that calls lapack to solve a linear
system ax=b.

    def weave_solve(a,b):
        n = len(a[0])
        x = numpy.array([0]*n,dtype=float)

                    int*perm,double*vec,int*size,int*ok);
        }
        """

        code="""
            int i,j;
            double* a_c;
            double* b_c;
            int size;
            int flag;

               }
            dgesv_(&size,&flag,a_c,&size,p,b_c,&size,&ok);
            for(i=0;i<n;i++)
               x(i)=b_c[i];
            free(a_c);
            free(b_c);
            free(p);

Note that we have used the support_code argument which is additional C code you can
use to include headers and declare functions. Note that inline also can take all distutils
compiler options which we used here to link in lapack.

Using our previous driver you should find that this version takes about the
same amount of time as the f2py version around .2 seconds to do 2750
iterations.
