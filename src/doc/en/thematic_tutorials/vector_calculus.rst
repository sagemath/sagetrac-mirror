Tutorial: Vector calculus in Euclidean spaces
=============================================

.. MODULEAUTHOR:: Eric Gourgoulhon (Observatoire de Paris)

Here you can find various tutorials about vector calculus with SageMath.
The first three ones regard vector calculus in the 3-dimensional Euclidean space
:math:`\mathbb{E}^3` with a fixed coordinate system (Cartesian, spherical and
cylindrical, respectively). The fourth tutorial is devoted to changes between the
above three coordinate systems. The fifth tutorial presents some advanced
aspects, namely the treatment of :math:`\mathbb{E}^3` as a Riemannian manifold.
Finally, the last tutorial is devoted to vector calculus in the Euclidean plane
:math:`\mathbb{E}^2`, using both Cartesian and polar coordinates.
