Tutorial: Vector Calculus in Euclidean Spaces
=============================================

.. MODULEAUTHOR:: Eric Gourgoulhon

This document contains various tutorials introducing vector calculus with
SageMath. The first three ones regard vector calculus in the 3-dimensional
Euclidean space :math:`\mathbb{E}^3` in a given coordinate system
(respectively Cartesian, spherical and cylindrical coordinates). The fourth
tutorial is devoted to changes between the above three coordinate systems. The
fifth tutorial presents some advanced aspects, namely the treatment of
:math:`\mathbb{E}^3` as a Riemannian manifold. Finally, the last tutorial is
devoted to 2-dimensional vector calculus, using both Cartesian and polar
coordinates in the Euclidean plane :math:`\mathbb{E}^2`, and combines various
features of the first five tutorials.
