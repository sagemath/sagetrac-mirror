PREP Tutorials
==============

This is a set of tutorials developed for the MAA PREP workshops "Sage:
Using Open\-Source Mathematics Software with Undergraduates" (funding
provided by the National Science Foundation under grant DUE 0817071) in
the summers of 2010-2012. It is licensed under the Creative Commons
Attribution\-ShareAlike 3.0 license (`CC BY\-SA
<http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/>`_).

The original audience for these tutorials was mathematics faculty at
undergraduate institutions with little or no experience with programming
or computer mathematics software.  Because the computer experience
required is quite minimal, this should be useful to anyone coming with
little such experience to Sage.

Although any mathematics the reader is not familiar with can simply be
skipped at first, we do assume throughout that the reader is familiar
with the concept of a function and different kinds of numbers.  We also
make liberal use of basic examples from calculus, linear algebra, and
other areas.  In the :doc:`Quickstart tutorials <quickstart>`, we assume
familiarity with the topics at the level of a student who has just
completed a course in the subject, or of a faculty member who is about
to teach it.
