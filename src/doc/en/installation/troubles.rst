Troubleshooting
===============

If no binary version is available for your system, you can fallback to
the :ref:`sec-installation-from-sources` or use one of the alternatives
proposed at the end of :ref:`installation-guide`.

If you have any problems building or running Sage, please take a look
at the Installation FAQ in the `Sage Release Tour
<https://wiki.sagemath.org/ReleaseTours>` corresponding to the version
that you are installing.  It may offer version-specific installation
help that has become available after the release was made and is
therefore not covered by this manual.

Also please do not hesitate to ask for help in the `SageMath forum
<https://ask.sagemath.org/questions/>`_ or the `sage-support mailing
list <https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/sage-support>`_.
