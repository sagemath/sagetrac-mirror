Troubleshooting
===============

If no binary version is available for your system, you can fallback to
the :ref:`sec-installation-from-sources` or use one of the alternatives
proposed at the end of :ref:`installation-guide`.

If you have any trouble, have a look at the
`FAQ wiki page <http://wiki.sagemath.org/faq#Otherquestions>`_,
the `SageMath forum <https://ask.sagemath.org/questions/>`_ or
the `sage-support mailing list <https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/sage-support>`_.
