Linux package managers
======================

On Debian GNU/Linux version >= 11, Ubuntu version >= 21.04, and
Arch Linux there are three packages to install

- ``sagemath`` (for the binaries)

- ``sagemath-jupyter`` (for the browser interface)

- and the documentation which is called ``sagemath-doc-en``
  on Debian/Ubuntu and ``sagemath-doc`` on Arch Linux.

See `repology.org: sagemath
<https://repology.org/project/sagemath/versions>`_ for information
about SageMath packages in other distributions, and their available
versions. Do not install a version of Sage older than 9.2.
If you are on an older version of your distribution and a recent
version of SageMath is only available on a newer version of the
distribution, consider upgrading your distribution.

Gentoo users might want to give a try to
`sage-on-gentoo <https://github.com/cschwan/sage-on-gentoo>`_.

The  :trac:`Trac wiki page Distribution <wiki/Distribution>` collects information
regarding packaging and distribution of SageMath.
