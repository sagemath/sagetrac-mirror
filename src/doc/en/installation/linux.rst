Linux package managers
======================

On GNU/Linux Debian version >= 9, Ubuntu version >= 18.04,
Arch Linux there are three packages to install

- ``sagemath`` (for the binaries)

- ``sagemath-jupyter`` (for the browser interface)

- and the documentation which is called ``sagemath-doc-en``
  on Debian/Ubuntu and ``sagemath-doc`` on Arch Linux.

Gentoo users might want to give a try to
`sage-on-gentoo <https://github.com/cschwan/sage-on-gentoo>`_.
