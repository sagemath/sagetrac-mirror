Launching SageMath
==================

Now we assume that you installed Sage properly on your system. This
section quickly explains how to start the Sage console and the Jupyter
notebook from the command line.

If you did install the Windows version of the Mac OS X applications you
should have icons available on your desktops or launching menus. Otherwise
you are strongly advised to create shorcuts for Sage as indicated as the end
of the "Linux" Section in :ref:`sec-installation-from-binaries`. Assuming
that you have this shortcut, running ``sage`` in a console starts a Sage
session. To quit the session enter ``quit`` and then press ``<Enter>``. To
start a Jupyter notebook instead of a Sage console, run the command
``sage -n jupyter`` instead of just ``sage``. To quit the Jupyter notebook
press ``<Ctrl> + <c>`` twice in the console where you launched the command.

For further reading you can have a look at the other documents in the
SageMath documentation at http://doc.sagemath.org/.
