Welcome to the Sage Installation Guide
======================================

You can install Sage either from a pre-built binary tarball or from source. The
binary method is fastest, and has the fewest prerequisites. The source method
gives you access to possibly a slightly more up-to-date version of Sage, and
ensures that you can modify any of the Sage source code and recompile. Also,
installing from source should be simpler than you're used to with most software,
since much testing is done to make sure Sage and all its components can be
successfully compiled with no user interaction on a range of computers. Thus
it's probably easier for you to build all of Sage from source than it would be
for you to build some of the packages that come with Sage (e.g., Singular).
