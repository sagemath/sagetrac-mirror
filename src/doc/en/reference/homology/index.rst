Cell complexes and their homology
=================================

Sage includes some tools for algebraic topology: from the algebraic
side, chain complexes and their homology, and from the topological
side, simplicial complexes, `\Delta`-complexes, cubical complexes, and
simplicial sets.  A class of generic cell complexes is also available,
mainly for developers who want to use it as a base for other types of
cell complexes.
