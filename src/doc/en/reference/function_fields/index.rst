Algebraic Function Fields
=========================

Sage provides basic computations with elements, ideals, and orders of general
function fields over arbitrary constant fields. Advanced computations, like
computing the genus of the field or a basis of the Riemann-Roch space of a
divisor, are available for global function fields.
