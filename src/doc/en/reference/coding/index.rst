Coding Theory

Code constructions
------------------

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 1

   sage/coding/linear_code

The named code families below are represented in Sage by their own classes,
allowing specialised implementations of e.g. decoding or computation of properties:

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 2

   sage/coding/grs
   sage/coding/hamming_code
   sage/coding/golay_code
   sage/coding/parity_check_code
   sage/coding/reed_muller_code
   sage/coding/cyclic_code
   sage/coding/bch

In contrast, for some code families Sage can only construct their generator
matrix and has no other a priori knowledge on them:

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 1

   sage/coding/code_constructions
   sage/coding/guava
   sage/coding/self_dual_codes
   sage/coding/binary_code

Derived Code Constructions
--------------------------

Sage supports the following derived code constructions. If the constituent code
is from a special code family, the derived codes inherit e.g. decoding or
minimum distance capabilities:

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 2

   sage/coding/subfield_subcode
   sage/coding/punctured_code
   sage/coding/extended_code

Other derived constructions that simply produce the modified generator matrix
can be found among the methods of a constructed code.
