Arithmetical binary operator precedence
=======================================

What is ``3^2*4 + 2%5``? The value (38) is determined by this
"operator precedence table". The table below is based on the table
in ยง 5.14 of the *Python Language Reference Manual* by G. Rossum
and F. Drake. the operations are listed here in increasing order of
precedence.

Therefore, to compute ``3^2*4 + 2%5``, Sage brackets the
computation this way: ``((3^2)*4) + (2%5)``. Thus, first compute
``3^2``, which is ``9``, then compute both ``(3^2)*4`` and ``2%5``,
and finally add these.
