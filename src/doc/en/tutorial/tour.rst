A Guided Tour
*************

This section is a guided tour of some of what is available in Sage.
For many more examples, see "Sage Constructions", which is intended
to answer the general question "How do I construct ...?". See also
the "Sage Reference Manual", which has thousands more examples.
Also note that you can interactively work through this tour in the
Sage notebook by clicking the ``Help`` link.

(If you are viewing the tutorial in the
Sage notebook, press ``shift-enter`` to evaluate
any input cell.  You can even edit the input
before pressing shift-enter.   On some Macs
you might have to press ``shift-return`` rather than ``shift-enter``.)
