===============================================================================

To build bernmm, you need to edit the makefile to point to your GMP and NTL
install directories, and then just do "make". This will create an executable
"bernmm-test". Run it with no arguments to see the available options.

In the makefile there is also a THREAD_STACK_SIZE option; the default is
4096 KB. If this option is not set, the system default thread stack size will
be used. This proved to be a problem on OS X, where GMP's mpz_invert routine
smashed the default 512 KB stack. For more info see
