Stage 1: Get all existing tests to pass in the following files (some
have no tests right now):

dist.py
distributions.py
fund_domain.py
modsym.py
modsym_dist.py
modsym_symk.py
pLfunction.py
symk.py

sage -tp 4 fund_domain.py lvalue_test.py modsym.py modsym_symk.py pLfunction.py

Stage 2: Come up with the simplest *design* for this functionality that
could possibly go into Sage and do the same thing as the above.

Parents:
   
 - CoefficientModule
    - Symk(k, base_field)
    - Distribution(...?)

 - OverconvergentModSymSpace(level, coefficient_module)


Elements:

 - CoefficientModuleElement
    - SymkElement
    - DistributionElement

 - OverconvergentModSymElement

Other Objects:

 - p-adic L-series (attached to overconvergent eigenform)
 - ManinRelations
 - ManinSymbol 

Example code:

sage: E = EllipticCurve('11a')
sage: f = E.overconvergent_modsym()
sage: f
Overconvergent modular symbol attached to Elliptic Curve defined by y^2 + y = x^3 - x^2 - 10*x - 20 over Rational Field
sage: L = f.padic_lseries(7)
sage: L
7-adic L-series of Overconvergent modular symbol attached to Elliptic Curve defined by y^2 + y = x^3 - x^2 - 10*x - 20 over Rational Field
sage: L.series(2)  # not sure about input/output
5 + 7 + 5*7^2 + 4*7^3 + O(7^4) + (5 + O(7))*T + (6 + O(7))*T^2 + O(7)*T^3 + (4 + O(7))*T^4 + O(T^5)
sage: L = f.padic_lseries(7, -3)  # twist by -3
sage: L
7-adic L-series of twist by -3 of Overconvergent modular symbol attached to Elliptic Curve defined by y^2 + y = x^3 - x^2 - 10*x - 20 over Rational Field

sage: f.domain()
?
sage: f(...)
?
sage: f.parent()
Space of overconvergent modular symbols of level 11

sage: f.minus_part()
Overconvergent modular symbol ...
sage: f.plus_part()
Overconvergent modular symbol ...

sage: f + f
?
sage: 2*f
?

sage: X = OverconvergentModularSymbols(...); X
?
sage: T2 = X.hecke_operator(2); T2
?
sage: T2(f)
?



Stage 3: Implement:

  - one group: write test suite (doctest/docstrings) using the new 
    function names/classes/etc.  Use the program above to generate
    the expected output

  - another group: "quick" implementation in Python of
    parents/elements/etc.  Will copy over a lot of code from above (or
    just refactor things, etc.)


TASKS:

Stage 4: Optimization

  - depends on results of stage 3.  Fast dist code is relevant.
