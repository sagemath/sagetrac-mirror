##     eps is [N, i x 3 matrix], where eps[2][,1] is the primes dividing
##     N, eps[2][,2] is the powers of these primes that divide N, and eps[2][,3]
##     is the following: for p odd, p^n||N, it's t such that znprimroot(p^n)
##     gets sent to exp(2*pi*i/phi(p^n))^t. And for p=2, it's
##     0 for 2^1, it's 0 (trivial) or -1 (non-trivial) for 2^2, and for p^n>=8

def buzzard_tpslopes(p, N, kmax):
    """
    Returns a vector of length kmax, whose `k`'th entry
    (`0 \leq k \leq k_{max}`) is the conjectural sequence
    of valuations of eigenvalues of `T_p` on forms of level
    `N`, weight `k`, and trivial character.

    This conjecture is due to Kevin Buzzard, and is only made assuming
    that `p` does not divide `N` and if `p` is
    `\Gamma_0(N)`-regular.

    EXAMPLES::

        sage: c = buzzard_tpslopes(2,1,50)
        sage: c[50]
        [4, 8, 13]

    Hence Buzzard would conjecture that the `2`-adic valuations
    of the eigenvalues of `T_2` on cusp forms of level 1 and
    weight `50` are `[4,8,13]`, which indeed they are,
    as one can verify by an explicit computation using, e.g., modular
    symbols::

        sage: M = ModularSymbols(1,50, sign=1).cuspidal_submodule()
        sage: T = M.hecke_operator(2)
        sage: f = T.charpoly('x')
        sage: f.newton_slopes(2)
        [13, 8, 4]
