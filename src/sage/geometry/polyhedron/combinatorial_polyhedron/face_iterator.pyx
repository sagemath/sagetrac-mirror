Face iterator for polyhedra

This iterator in principle works on every graded lattice, where
every interval of length two has exactly 4 elements (diamond property).

It also works on unbounded polyhedra, as those satisfy the diamond property,
except for intervals including the empty face.
A (slightly generalized) description of the algorithm can be found in [KS2019]_.

Terminology in this module:

- Coatoms               -- the faces from which all others are constructed in
                           the face iterator. This will be facets or Vrep.
                           In non-dual mode, faces are constructed as
                           intersections of the facets. In dual mode, the are
                           constructed theoretically as joins of vertices.
                           The coatoms are repsented as incidences with the
                           atoms they contain.
- Atoms                 -- facets or Vrep depending on application of algorithm.
                           Atoms are repsented as incidences of coatoms they
                           are contained in.

EXAMPLES:

Construct a face iterator::

    sage: from sage.geometry.polyhedron.combinatorial_polyhedron.face_iterator \
    ....:         import FaceIterator
    sage: P = polytopes.octahedron()
    sage: C = CombinatorialPolyhedron(P)

    sage: FaceIterator(C, False)
    Iterator over the proper faces of a 3-dimensional combinatorial polyhedron
    sage: FaceIterator(C, False, output_dimension=2)
    Iterator over the 2-faces of a 3-dimensional combinatorial polyhedron

Iterator in the non-dual mode starts with facets::

    sage: it = FaceIterator(C, False)
    sage: [next(it) for _ in range(9)]
    [A 2-dimensional face of a 3-dimensional combinatorial polyhedron,
     A 2-dimensional face of a 3-dimensional combinatorial polyhedron,
     A 2-dimensional face of a 3-dimensional combinatorial polyhedron,
     A 2-dimensional face of a 3-dimensional combinatorial polyhedron,
     A 2-dimensional face of a 3-dimensional combinatorial polyhedron,
     A 2-dimensional face of a 3-dimensional combinatorial polyhedron,
     A 2-dimensional face of a 3-dimensional combinatorial polyhedron,
     A 2-dimensional face of a 3-dimensional combinatorial polyhedron,
     A 1-dimensional face of a 3-dimensional combinatorial polyhedron]

Iterator in the dual-mode starts with vertices::

    sage: it = FaceIterator(C, True)
    sage: [next(it) for _ in range(7)]
    [A 0-dimensional face of a 3-dimensional combinatorial polyhedron,
     A 0-dimensional face of a 3-dimensional combinatorial polyhedron,
     A 0-dimensional face of a 3-dimensional combinatorial polyhedron,
     A 0-dimensional face of a 3-dimensional combinatorial polyhedron,
     A 0-dimensional face of a 3-dimensional combinatorial polyhedron,
     A 0-dimensional face of a 3-dimensional combinatorial polyhedron,
     A 1-dimensional face of a 3-dimensional combinatorial polyhedron]

Obtain the Vrepresentation::

    sage: it = FaceIterator(C, False)
    sage: face = next(it)
    sage: face.ambient_Vrepresentation()
    (A vertex at (0, -1, 0), A vertex at (0, 0, -1), A vertex at (1, 0, 0))
    sage: face.n_ambient_Vrepresentation()
    3

Obtain the facet-representation::

    sage: it = FaceIterator(C, True)
    sage: face = next(it)
    sage: face.ambient_Hrepresentation()
    (An inequality (-1, -1, 1) x + 1 >= 0,
     An inequality (-1, -1, -1) x + 1 >= 0,
      An inequality (-1, 1, -1) x + 1 >= 0,
       An inequality (-1, 1, 1) x + 1 >= 0)
    sage: face.ambient_H_indices()
    (4, 5, 6, 7)
    sage: face.n_ambient_Hrepresentation()
    4

In non-dual mode one can ignore all faces contained in the current face::

    sage: it = FaceIterator(C, False)
    sage: face = next(it)
    sage: face.ambient_H_indices()
    (7,)
    sage: it.ignore_subfaces()
    sage: [face.ambient_H_indices() for face in it]
    [(6,),
    (5,),
    (4,),
    (3,),
    (2,),
    (1,),
    (0,),
    (5, 6),
    (1, 6),
    (0, 1, 5, 6),
    (4, 5),
    (0, 5),
    (0, 3, 4, 5),
    (3, 4),
    (2, 3),
    (0, 3),
    (0, 1, 2, 3),
    (1, 2),
    (0, 1)]

In dual mode one can ignore all faces that contain the current face::

    sage: it = FaceIterator(C, True)
    sage: face = next(it)
    sage: face.ambient_V_indices()
    (5,)
    sage: it.ignore_supfaces()
    sage: [face.ambient_V_indices() for face in it]
    [(4,),
    (3,),
    (2,),
    (1,),
    (0,),
    (3, 4),
    (2, 4),
    (0, 4),
    (0, 3, 4),
    (0, 2, 4),
    (1, 3),
    (0, 3),
    (0, 1, 3),
    (1, 2),
    (0, 2),
    (0, 1, 2),
    (0, 1)]

There is a special face iterator class for geometric polyhedra.
It yields (geometric) polyhedral faces and it also yields trivial faces.
Otherwise, it works exactly the same::

    sage: from sage.geometry.polyhedron.combinatorial_polyhedron.face_iterator \
    ....:         import FaceIterator_geom
    sage: P = polytopes.cube()
    sage: it = FaceIterator_geom(P)
    sage: [next(it) for _ in range(5)]
    [A 3-dimensional face of a Polyhedron in ZZ^3 defined as the convex hull of 8 vertices,
     A -1-dimensional face of a Polyhedron in ZZ^3,
     A 2-dimensional face of a Polyhedron in ZZ^3 defined as the convex hull of 4 vertices,
     A 2-dimensional face of a Polyhedron in ZZ^3 defined as the convex hull of 4 vertices,
     A 2-dimensional face of a Polyhedron in ZZ^3 defined as the convex hull of 4 vertices]
    sage: it
    Iterator over the faces of a 3-dimensional polyhedron in ZZ^3

    ALGORITHM:

    For the special case that the all intervals of the lattice not containing zero are boolean
    (e.g. when the polyhedron is simple) the algorithm is modified. See below.


    A (slightly generalized) description of the algorithm can be found in [KS2019]_.

    The algorithm to visit all proper faces exactly once is roughly
    equivalent to::

        faces = [set(facet) for facet in P.facets()]
        face_iterator(faces, [])

        def face_iterator(faces, visited_all):
            # Visit all faces of a polyhedron `P`, except those contained in
            # any of the visited all.

            # Assumes ``faces`` to be exactly those facets of `P`
            # that are not contained in any of the ``visited_all``.

            # Assumes ``visited_all`` to be some list of faces of
            # a polyhedron `P_2`, which contains `P` as one of its faces.

            while facets:
                one_face = faces.pop()
                new_faces = [one_face.intersection(face) for face in faces]

                # ``maybe_new_faces`` contains all facets of ``one_face``,
                # which we have not visited before.
                # Proof: Let `F` be a facet of ``one_face``.
                # We have a chain:
                # `P` ⊃ ``one_face`` ⊃ `F`.
                # By diamond property there exists ``second_face`` with:
                # `P` ⊃ ``second_face`` ⊃ `F`.

                # Either ``second_face`` is not an element of ``faces``:
                #     Hence ``second_face`` is contained in one of ``visited_all``.
                #     In particular, `F` is contained in ``visited_all``.
                # Or ``second_face`` is an element of ``faces``:
                #     Then, intersecting ``one_face`` with ``second_face`` gives
                #     ``F``. ∎

                # If an element in ``maybe_new_faces`` is inclusion maximal
                # and not contained in any of the ``visited_all``,
                # it is a facet of ``one_face``.
                # Any facet in ``maybe_new_faces`` of ``one_face``
                # is inclusion maximal.
                maybe_new_faces2 = []
                for i, face1 in enumerate(maybe_new_faces):
                    # ``face1`` is a facet of ``one_face``,
                    # iff it is not contained in another facet.
                    if (all(not face1 < face2 for face2 in maybe_new_faces[:i])
                            and all(not face1 <= face2 for face2 in maybe_new_faces[i+1:])):
                        maybe_new_faces2.append(face1)

                # ``maybe_new_faces2`` contains only facets of ``one_face``
                # and some faces contained in any of ``visited_all``.
                # It also contains all the facets not contained in any of ``visited_all``.
                # Let ``new_faces`` be the list of all facets of ``one_face``
                # not contained in any of ``visited_all``.
                new_faces = []
                for face1 in maybe_new_faces2:
                    if all(not face1 < face2 for face2 in visited_all):
                        new_faces.append(face1)

                # By induction we can apply the algorithm, to visit all
                # faces of ``one_face`` not contained in ``visited_all``:
                face_iterator(new_faces, visited_all)

                # Finally visit ``one_face`` and add it to ``visited_all``:
                visit(one_face)
                visited_all.append(one_face)

                # Note: At this point, we have visited exactly those faces,
                # contained in any of the ``visited_all``.


    For the special case that the all intervals of the lattice not containing zero are boolean
    (e.g. when the polyhedron is simple), the algorithm can be modified.

    We do not assume any other properties of our lattice in this case.
    Note that intervals of length 2 not containing zero, have exactly 2 elements now.
    But the atom-representation of faces might not be unique.

    We do the following modifications:

    - To check whether an intersection of faces is zero, we check whether the
      atom-representation is zero. Although not unique,
      it works to distinct from zero.

    - The intersection of two (relative) facets has always codimension `1` unless empty.

    - To intersect we now additionally unite the coatom representation.
      This gives the correct representation of the new face
      unless the intersection is zero.

    - To mark a face as visited, we save its coatom representation.

    - To check whether we have seen a face already, we check containment of the coatom representation.
