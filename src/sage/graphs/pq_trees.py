class PQ:
    r"""
    This class implements the PQ-Tree, used for the recognition of
    Interval Graphs, or equivalently for matrices having the so-caled
    "consecutive ones property".

    Briefly, we are given a collection `C=S_1, ..., S_n` of sets on a
    common ground set `X`, and we would like to reorder the elements
    of `C` in such a way that for every element `x\in X` such that
    `x\in S_i` and `x\in S_j`, `i<j`, we have `x\in S_l` for all
    `i<l<j`. This property could also be rephrased as : the sets
    containing `x` are an interval.

    To achieve it, we will actually compute ALL the orderings
    satisfying such constraints using the structure of PQ-Tree, by
    adding the constraints one at a time.

        * At first, there is no constraint : all the permutations are
          allowed. We will then build a tree composed of one node
          linked to all the sets in our collection (his children). As
          we want to remember that all the permutations of his
          children are allowed, we will label it with "P", making it a
          P-Tree.

        * We are now picking an element `x \in X`, and we want to
          ensure that all the elements `C_x` containing it are
          contiguous. We can remove them from their tree `T_1`, create
          a second tree `T_2` whose only children are the `C_x`, and
          attach this `T_2` to `T_1`. We also make this new tree a
          `P-Tree`, as all the elements of `C_x` can be permuted as
          long as they stay close to each other. Obviously, the whole
          tree `T_2` can be prmuter with the other children of `T_1`
          in any way -- it does not impair the fact that the sequence
          of the children will ensure the sets containing `x` are
          contiguous.

        * We would like to repeat the same procedure for `x' \in X`,
          but we are now encountering a problem : there may be sets
          containing both `x'` and `x`, along with others containing
          only `x` or only `x'`. We can permute the sets containing
          only `x'` together, or the sets containing both `x` and `x'`
          together, but we may NOT permute all the sets containing
          `x'` together as this may break the relationship between the
          sets containing `x`. We need `Q`-Trees. A `Q`-Tree is a tree
          whose children are ordered, even though their order could be
          reversed (if the children of a `Q`-Tree are `c_1c_2
          ... c_k`, we can change it to `c_k ... c_2c_1`). We can now
          express all the orderings satisfying our two constraints the
          following way :

            * We create a tree `T_1` gathering all the elements not
              containing `x` nor `x'`, and make it a `P-Tree`

            * We create 3 `P`-Trees `T_{x, x'}, T_x, T_{x'}`, which
              respectively have for children the elements or our
              collection containing

                * both `x` and `x'`
                * only `x`
                * only `x'`

            * To ensure our constraints on both elements, we create a
              `Q`-tree `T_2` whose children are in order `T_x, T_{x,
              x'}, T_{x'}`

            * We now make this `Q`-Tree `T_2` a children of the
              `P`-Tree `T_1`

    Using these two types of tree, and exploring the different cases
    of intersection, it is possible to represent all the possible
    permutations of our sets satisfying or constraints, or to prove
    that no such ordering exists. This is the whole purpose of this
    class and this algorithm, and is explained with more details in many
    places, for example in the following document from Hajiaghayi [Haj]_.

        r"""
        Updates ``self`` so that its sets containing ``v`` are
        contiguous for any admissible permutation of its subtrees.

        This function also ensures, whenever possible,
        that all the sets containing ``v`` are located on an interval
        on the right side of the ordering.

        INPUT:

        - ``v`` -- an element of the ground set

        OUTPUT:

        According to the cases :

            * ``(EMPTY, ALIGNED)`` if no set of the tree contains
              an occurrence of ``v``

            * ``(FULL, ALIGNED)`` if all the sets of the tree contain
              ``v``

            * ``(PARTIAL, ALIGNED)`` if some (but not all) of the sets
              contain ``v``, all of which are aligned
              to the right of the ordering at the end when the function ends

            * ``(PARTIAL, UNALIGNED)`` if some (but not all) of the
              sets contain ``v``, though it is impossible to align them
              all to the right

        In any case, the sets containing ``v`` are contiguous when this
        function ends. If there is no possibility of doing so, the function
        raises a ``ValueError`` exception.

        EXAMPLE:

        Ensuring the sets containing ``0`` are continuous::

            sage: from sage.graphs.pq_trees import P, Q
            sage: q = Q([[2,3], Q([[3,0],[3,1]]), Q([[4,0],[4,5]])])

            sage: print q
            ('Q', [{2, 3}, {1, 3}, {0, 3}, {0, 4}, {4, 5}])

        Impossible situation::

            sage: p = Q([[0,1], [1,2], [2,0]])
            sage: p.set_contiguous(0)
