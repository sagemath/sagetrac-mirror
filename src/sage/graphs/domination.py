Functions related to domination.

This file contains varied functions related to domination as well as an
implementation of the algorithm described in _Enumerating minimal
dominating sets in $K_t$-free graphs and variants_ by Marthe Bonamy,
Oscar Defrain, Marc Heinrich, Micha≈Ç Pilipczuk, and Jean-Florent Raymond
(https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.00789 ) to enumerate the minimal dominating
