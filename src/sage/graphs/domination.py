dominating sets in $K_t$-free graphs and variants_ by Marthe Bonamy,
Oscar Defrain, Marc Heinrich, Micha≈Ç Pilipczuk, and Jean-Florent Raymond

def _parent(G, dom, V_prev):
    r'''
    Return an subset of dom that is irredundant in V_prev.

    For internal use.

    INPUT:
    
    - ``dom`` -- an iterable of vertices of ``self``
    - ``V_prev`` -- an iterable of vertices of ``self``

    OUTPUT:

    Return the list obtained from ``dom`` by iteratively removing those
    vertices of mininum index that have no private neighbor in V_prev.

    EXAMPLES:

        sage: from sage.graphs.domination import _parent
        sage: G = graphs.PathGraph(4)
        sage: G.add_vertices([4, 5])

def _peel(G, A):
    r'''
    Return a peeling of a vertex iterable of a graph.

    For internal use.
    Given a graph `G` and a subset `A` of its vertices, a peeling
    of `(G,A)` is a list $[(u_0, V_0), \dots, (u_{p}, V_{p})]$ such
    that $u_0$ is is `None`, $V_0$ is the empty set,
    $V_p = A$ and for every $i \in $\{1, \dots, p\}$,
    $V_{i-1} = V_i \setminus N[v_i]$, for some $u_i\in V_i$.

    INPUT:
    
    - ``G`` -- a graph
    - ``A`` -- a set of vertices of ``G``

    OUTPUT:

    A peeling of `(G,A)`.

def _cand_ext_enum(G, dom_par, u_next, V_next):
    r'''
    Return an iterator over the candidate extensions of ``dom_par`` to ``V_next``.

    For internal use. (See description below.)
    
    INPUT:

    - `G` -- a graph
    - `dom_par` -- an iterable over some vertices of `G`
    - `u_next` -- a vertex of `G`
    - `V_next` -- an iterable over some vertices of `G`
    
    OUTPUT:

    An iterator over all sets `X` that dominate
    $N(u_next) \cap V_next \setminus N[dom_par]$ and are inclusion-wise
    minimal (hereafter called candidate extensions of ``dom_par`` to ``V_next``).

    Intuitively, we have a partial (irredundant) dominating set `dom_par` and we
    want to extend it to `V_next`. For this we enumerate all the minimal
    dominating sets of $N(u_next) \cap V_next \setminus N[dom_par]$,
    which will contain all the extensions of `dom_par` into a minimal dominating
    set of `V_next`. (Note that by doing so we also enumerate sets `X` such
    that $dom_par \cup X$ is dominating `V_next` but is not minimal.)
