Functions related to domination.

This file contains varied functions related to domination as well as an
implementation of the algorithm described in _Enumerating minimal
dominating sets in $K_t$-free graphs and variants_ by Marthe Bonamy,
Oscar Defrain, Marc Heinrich, Micha≈Ç Pilipczuk, and Jean-Florent Raymond
:arxiv:`1810.00789` to enumerate the minimal dominating sets of a graph.

def _parent(G, dom, V_prev):
    r'''
    Return an subset of dom that is irredundant in V_prev.

    For internal use.

    INPUT:
    
    - ``dom`` -- an iterable of vertices of ``self``
    - ``V_prev`` -- an iterable of vertices of ``self``

    OUTPUT:

    Return the list obtained from ``dom`` by iteratively removing those
    vertices of mininum index that have no private neighbor in V_prev.

    EXAMPLES:

        sage: G = graphs.PathGraph(4)
        sage: G.add_vertices([4, 5])
        sage: G.add_edges([(4, 1), (5, 2)])

def _peel(G, A):
    r'''

    For internal use.
    Given a graph `G` and a subset `A` of its vertices, a peeling
    of `(G,A)` is a list $[(u_0, V_0), \dots, (u_{p+1}, V_{p+1})]$ such
    that $u_0$ and $u_{p+1}$ are `None`, $V_0$ is the empty set,
    $V_{p+1} = V(G)$, $V_p = A$ and for every $i \in $\{1, \dots, p\}$,
    $V_{i-1} = V_i \setminus N[v_i]$, for some $u_i\in V_i$.

    INPUT:
    
    - ``G`` -- a graph
    - ``A`` -- an iterable of vertices of ``G``

    OUTPUT:

    A peeling of `(G,A)`.
