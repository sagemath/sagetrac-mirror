Partial cubes

A partial cube is a graph that can be isometrically embedded into a hypercube,
i.e., its vertices can be labelled with (0,1)-vectors of some fixed length such
that the distance between any two vertices in the graph equals the Hamming
distance of their labels.

The code in this module is originally from the PADS library by David Eppstein,
which is available at http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/PADS/ under the MIT
license. The algorithm for partial cube recognition in quadratic time has been
described in [Eppstein2008]_.

def breadth_first_level_search(G, start, ignore_direction=False, neighbors=None):
    r"""
    Generate a sequence of dictionaries, each mapping the vertices from level i
    to a set of their neighbours at level i+1.

    Originally written by D. Eppstein for the PADS library
    (http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/PADS/).

    INPUT:

    - ``G`` -- a graph to perform the search on.

    - ``start`` -- vertex or list of vertices from which to start the traversal.

    - ``ignore_direction`` -- (default ``False``) only applies to directed
      graphs. If ``True``, searches across edges in either direction.

    - ``neighbors`` -- a function giving the neighbors of a vertex.
      The function should take a vertex and return a list of
      vertices.  For a graph, ``neighbors`` is by default the
      :meth:`~GenericGraph.neighbor_iterator` function of the graph. For a
      digraph, the ``neighbors`` function defaults to the
      :meth:`~DiGraph.neighbor_out_iterator` function of the graph.

    EXAMPLE::

        sage: H = graphs.HeawoodGraph()
        sage: list(sage.graphs.partial_cube.breadth_first_level_search(H, 0))

def is_partial_cube(G, certificate=False):

    Test whether the given graph is a partial cube.

    Originally written by D. Eppstein for the PADS library
    (http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/PADS/), see also [Eppstein2008]_.
    The algorithm runs in O(n^2) time, where n is the number of vertices.

    INPUT:

    - ``certificate`` (boolean; ``False``) -- The function returns ``True``
      or ``False`` according to the graph, when ``certificate = False``. When
      ``certificate = True`` and the graph is a partial cube, the function
      returns ``(True, mapping)``, where ``mapping`` is an isometric mapping of
      the vertices of the graph to the vertices of a hypercube ((0, 1)-strings
      of a fixed length). When ``certificate = True`` and the graph is not a
      partial cube, ``(False, None)`` is returned.

    EXAMPLES:

    The Petersen graph is not a partial cube::

        sage: g = graphs.PetersenGraph()
        sage: g.is_partial_cube()
        False
