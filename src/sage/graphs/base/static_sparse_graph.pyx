Static Sparse Graphs

What is the point ?
-------------------

This class implements a Cython (di)graph structure made for efficiency. The
graphs are *static*, i.e. no add/remove vertex/edges methods are available, nor
can they easily or efficiently be implemented within this data structure.

The data structure, however, is made to save the maximum amount of computations
for graph algorithms whose main operation is to *list the out-neighbours of a
vertex* (which is precisely what BFS, DFS, distance computations and the
flow-related stuff waste their life on).

The code contained in this module is written C-style. The purpose is efficiency
and simplicity.

For an overview of graph data structures in sage, see
:mod:`~sage.graphs.base.overview`.

Data structure
--------------

.. image:: ../../../media/structure.png

The data structure is actually pretty simple and compact. ``short_digraph`` has
five fields

    * ``n`` (``int``) -- the number of vertices in the graph.

    * ``m`` (``int``) -- the number of edges in the graph.

    * ``edges`` (``uint32_t *``) -- array whose length is the number of edges of
      the graph.

    * ``neighbors`` (``uint32_t **``) -- this array has size `n+1`, and
      describes how the data of ``edges`` should be read : the neighbors of
      vertex `i` are the elements of ``edges`` addressed by
      ``neighbors[i]...neighbors[i+1]-1``. The element ``neighbors[n]``, which
      corresponds to no vertex (they are numbered from `0` to `n-1`) is present
      so that it remains easy to enumerate the neighbors of vertex `n-1` : the
      last of them is the element addressed by ``neighbors[n]-1``.

    * ``edge_labels`` -- this cython list associates a label to each edge of the
      graph. If a given edge is represented by ``edges[i]``, this its associated
      label can be found at ``edge_labels[i]``. This object is usually NULL,
      unless the call to ``init_short_digraph`` explicitly requires the labels
      to be stored in the data structure.

In the example given above, vertex 0 has 2,3,5,7,8 and 9 as out-neighbors, but
not 4, which is an out-neighbour of vertex 1. Vertex `n-1` has 2, 5, 8 and 9 as
out-neighbors. `\text{neighbors[n]}` points toward the cell immediately *after*
the end of `\text{edges}`, hence *outside of the allocated memory*. It is used
to indicate the end of the outneighbors of vertex `n-1`

**Iterating over the edges**

This is *the one thing* to have in mind when working with this data structure::

    cdef list_edges(short_digraph g):
        cdef int i, j
        for i in range(g.n):
            for j in range(g.neighbors[i+1]-g.neighbors[i]):
                print "There is an edge from",str(i),"to",g.neighbors[i][j]

**Advantages**

Two great points :

    * The neighbors of a vertex are C types, and are contiguous in memory.
    * Storing such graphs is incredibly cheaper than storing Python structures.

Well, I think it would be hard to have anything more efficient than that to
enumerate out-neighbors in sparse graphs ! :-)

Technical details
-----------------

    * When creating a ``fast_digraph`` from a ``Graph`` or ``DiGraph`` named
      ``G``, the `i^{\text{th}}` vertex corresponds to ``G.vertices()[i]``

    * Some methods return ``bitset_t`` objets when lists could be
      expected. There is a very useful ``bitset_list`` function for this kind of
      problems :-)

    * When the edges are labelled, most of the space taken by this graph is
      taken by edge labels. If no edge is labelled then this space is not
      allocated, but if *any* edge has a label then a (possibly empty) label is
      stored for each edge, which can double the memory needs.

    * The data structure stores the number of edges, even though it appears that
      this number can be reconstructed with
      ``g.neighbors[n]-g.neighbors[0]``. The trick is that not all elements of
      the ``g.edges`` array are necessarily used : when an undirected graph
      contains loops, only one entry of the array of size `2m` is used to store
      it, instead of the expected two. Storing the number of edges is the only
      way to avoid an uselessly costly computation to obtain the number of edges
      of an undirected, looped, AND labelled graph (think of several loops on
      the same vertex with different labels).

    * The codes of this module are well documented, and many answers can be
      found directly in the code.

Cython functions
----------------

.. csv-table::
    :class: contentstable
    :widths: 30, 70
    :delim: |

    ``init_short_digraph(short_digraph g, G)`` | Initializes ``short_digraph g`` from a Sage (Di)Graph.
    ``int n_edges(short_digraph g)`` | Returns the number of edges in ``g``
    ``int out_degree(short_digraph g, int i)`` | Returns the out-degree of vertex `i` in ``g``
    ``has_edge(short_digraph g, int u, int v)`` | Tests the existence of an edge.
    ``edge_label(short_digraph g, int * edge)`` | Returns the label associated with a given edge
    ``init_empty_copy(short_digraph dst, short_digraph src)`` | Allocates ``dst`` so that it can contain as many vertices and edges as ``src``.
    ``init_reverse(short_digraph dst, short_digraph src)`` | Initializes ``dst`` to a copy of ``src`` with all edges in the opposite direction.
    ``free_short_digraph(short_digraph g)`` | Free the ressources used by ``g``

**Connectivity**

``can_be_reached_from(short_digraph g, int src, bitset_t reached)``

    Assuming ``bitset_t reached`` has size at least ``g.n``, this method updates
    ``reached`` so that it represents the set of vertices that can be reached
    from ``src`` in ``g``.

``strongly_connected_component_containing_vertex(short_digraph g, short_digraph g_reversed, int v, bitset_t scc)``

    Assuming ``bitset_t reached`` has size at least ``g.n``, this method updates
    ``scc`` so that it represents the vertices of the strongly connected
    component containing ``v`` in ``g``. The variable ``g_reversed`` is assumed
    to represent the reverse of ``g``.

What is this module used for ?
------------------------------

At the moment, it is only used in the :mod:`sage.graphs.distances_all_pairs` module.

Python functions
----------------

These functions are available so that Python modules from Sage can call the
Cython routines this module implements (as they can not directly call methods
with C arguments).
