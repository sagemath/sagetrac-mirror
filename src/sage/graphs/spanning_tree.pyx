    r"""
    Minimum spanning tree using Kruskal's algorithm.

    This function assumes that we can only compute minimum spanning trees for
    undirected simple graphs. Such graphs can be weighted or unweighted.

    INPUT:

    - ``G`` -- A graph. This can be an undirected graph, a digraph, a
      multigraph, or a multidigraph. Note the following behaviours:

      - If ``G`` is unweighted, then consider the simple version of ``G``
        with all self-loops and multiple edges removed.

      - If ``G`` is directed, then we only consider its undirected version.

      - If ``G`` is weighted, we ignore all of its self-loops. Note that a
        weighted graph should only have numeric weights. You cannot assign
        numeric weights to some edges of ``G``, but have ``None`` as a
        weight for some other edge. If your input graph is weighted, you are
        responsible for assign numeric weight to each of its edges.
        Furthermore, we remove multiple edges as follows. First we convert
        ``G`` to be undirected. Suppose there are multiple edges from `u` to
        `v`. Among all such multiple edges, we choose one with minimum weight.

    - ``wfunction`` -- A weight function: a function that takes an edge and
      returns a numeric weight. Default: ``None``. The default is to
      assign each edge a weight of 1.

    - ``check`` -- Whether to first perform sanity checks on the input
      graph ``G``. Default: ``check=False``. If we toggle ``check=True``, the
      following sanity checks are first performed on ``G`` prior to running
      Kruskal's algorithm on that input graph:

      - Is ``G`` the null graph?
      - Is ``G`` disconnected?
      - Is ``G`` a tree?
      - Is ``G`` directed?
      - Does ``G`` have self-loops?
      - Does ``G`` have multiple edges?
      - Is ``G`` weighted?

      By default, we turn off the sanity checks for performance reasons. This
      means that by default the function assumes that its input graph is
      simple, connected, is not a tree, and has at least one vertex.
      If the input graph does not satisfy all of the latter conditions, you
      should set ``check=True`` to perform some sanity checks and
      preprocessing on the input graph. To further improve the runtime of this
      function, you should call it directly instead of using it indirectly
      via :meth:`sage.graphs.generic_graph.GenericGraph.min_spanning_tree`.

    OUTPUT:

    The edges of a minimum spanning tree of ``G``, if one exists, otherwise
    returns the empty list.

    - If ``G`` is a tree, return the edges of ``G`` regardless of whether
      ``G`` is weighted or unweighted, directed or undirected.

    - If ``G`` is unweighted, default to using unit weight for each edge of
      ``G``. The default behaviour is to use the already assigned weights of
      ``G`` provided that ``G`` is weighted.

    - If ``G`` is weighted and a weight function is also supplied, then use
      the already assigned weights of ``G``, not the weight function. If you
      really want to use a weight function for ``G`` even if ``G`` is
      weighted, first convert ``G`` to be unweighted and pass in the weight
      function.

    EXAMPLES:

    An example from pages 727--728 in [Sahni2000]_. ::

        sage: from sage.graphs.spanning_tree import kruskal
        sage: G = Graph({1:{2:28, 6:10}, 2:{3:16, 7:14}, 3:{4:12}, 4:{5:22, 7:18}, 5:{6:25, 7:24}})
        sage: G.weighted(True)
        sage: E = kruskal(G, check=True); E
        [(1, 6, 10), (3, 4, 12), (2, 7, 14), (2, 3, 16), (4, 5, 22), (5, 6, 25)]

    Variants of the previous example. ::

        sage: H = Graph(G.edges(labels=False))
        sage: kruskal(H, check=True)
        [(1, 2, None), (1, 6, None), (2, 3, None), (2, 7, None), (3, 4, None), (4, 5, None)]
        sage: H = DiGraph(G.edges(labels=False))
        sage: kruskal(H, check=True)
        [(1, 2, None), (1, 6, None), (2, 3, None), (2, 7, None), (3, 4, None), (4, 5, None)]
        sage: G.allow_loops(True)
        sage: G.allow_multiple_edges(True)
        sage: G
        Looped multi-graph on 7 vertices
        sage: for i in range(20):
        ...       u = randint(1, 7)
        ...       v = randint(1, 7)
        ...       w = randint(0, 20)
        ...       G.add_edge(u, v, w)
        sage: H = copy(G)
        sage: H
        Looped multi-graph on 7 vertices
        sage: def sanitize(G):
        ...       G.allow_loops(False)
        ...       E = {}
        ...       for u, v, _ in G.multiple_edges():
        ...           E.setdefault(u, v)
        ...       for u in E:
        ...           W = sorted(G.edge_label(u, E[u]))
        ...           for w in W[1:]:
        ...               G.delete_edge(u, E[u], w)
        ...       G.allow_multiple_edges(False)
        sage: sanitize(H)

        Graph on 7 vertices
        sage: kruskal(G, check=True) == kruskal(H, check=True)
        True

    Note that we only consider an undirected version of the input graph. Thus
    if ``G`` is a weighted multidigraph and ``H`` is an undirected version of
    ``G``, then this function should return the same minimum spanning tree
    for both ``G`` and ``H``. ::

    r"""
    Return a random spanning tree of the graph.

    This uses the Aldous-Broder algorithm ([Broder89]_, [Aldous90]_)
    to generate a random spanning tree with the uniform distribution,
    as follows.

    Start from any vertex. Perform a random walk by choosing at every
    step one neighbor uniformly at random. Every time a new vertex `j`
    is met, add the edge `(i, j)` to the spanning tree, where `i` is
    the previous vertex in the random walk.

    INPUT:

    - ``output_as_graph`` -- boolean (default: ``False``) whether to return a
      list of edges or a graph.

    EXAMPLES::

        sage: G = graphs.TietzeGraph()
        sage: G.random_spanning_tree(output_as_graph=True)
        Graph on 12 vertices
        sage: rg = G.random_spanning_tree(); rg # random
        [(0, 9),
        (9, 11),
        (0, 8),
        (8, 7),
        (7, 6),
        (7, 2),
        (2, 1),
        (1, 5),
        (9, 10),
        (5, 4),
        (2, 3)]
        sage: Graph(rg).is_tree()
        True

    A visual example for the grid graph::

        sage: G = graphs.Grid2dGraph(6, 6)
        sage: pos = G.get_pos()
        sage: T = G.random_spanning_tree(True)
        sage: T.set_pos(pos)
        sage: T.show(vertex_labels=False)

    TESTS::

        sage: G = Graph()
        sage: G.random_spanning_tree()
        Traceback (most recent call last):
        ...
        ValueError: works only for non-empty connected graphs

        sage: G = graphs.CompleteGraph(3).complement()
        sage: G.random_spanning_tree()
        Traceback (most recent call last):
