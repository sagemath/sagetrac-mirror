Sage package management commands

A Sage package has the extension .spkg. It is a tarball that is
(usually) bzip2 compressed that contains arbitrary data and an
spkg-install file. An Sage package typically has the following
components:


-  spkg-install - shell script that is run to install the package

-  Sage.txt - file that describes how the package was made, who
   maintains it, etc.

-  sage - directory with extra patched version of files that needed
   during the install


Use the ``install_package`` command to install a new
package, and use ``optional_packages`` to list all
optional packages available on the central Sage server. The
``upgrade`` command upgrades all *standard* packages -
there is no auto-upgrade command for optional packages.

All package management can also be done via the Sage command line.

def install_all_optional_packages(force=True, dry_run=False):
    r"""
    Install all available optional spkg's in the official Sage spkg
    repository.  Returns a list of all spkg's that *fail* to install.

    INPUT:

    - ``force`` -- bool (default: ``True``); whether to force
      reinstall of spkg's that are already installed.

    - ``dry_run`` -- bool (default: ``False``); if ``True``, just list
      the packages that would be installed in order, but don't
      actually install them.

    OUTPUT:

        list of strings

    .. NOTE::

        This is designed mainly for testing purposes.  This also
        doesn't do anything with respect to dependencies -- the
        packages are installed in alphabetical order.  Dependency
        issues will be dealt with in a future version.
