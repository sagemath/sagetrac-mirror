Asymptotic Term Monoid

This module implements asymptotic term monoids. The elements of these
monoids are used behind the scenes when performing calculations in an
asymptotic ring (to be implemented).

The monoids build upon the (asymptotic) growth groups. While growth
elements only model the growth of a function as it tends towards
infinity (or tends towards another fixed point; see
:mod:`~sage.groups.asymptotic_growth_group` for more details), an
asymptotic term additonally specifies its "type" and performs the
actual arithmetic operations (multiplication and partial
addition/absorption of terms).

Besides an abstract base term :class:`GenericTerm`, this module
implements the following types of terms:

- :class:`OTerm` -- O terms in infinity, see
  :wikipedia:`Big_O_notation`.
- :class:`TermWithCoefficient` -- abstract base class for
  asymptotic terms with coefficients.
- :class:`ExactTerm` -- this class represents a growth element
  multiplied with some non-zero coefficient from a base ring.

A characteristic property of asymptotic terms is that some terms are
able to "absorb" other terms (see
:meth:`sage.monoids.AsymptoticTermMonoid.GenericTerm.absorb`). For
instance, `O(x^2)` is able to absorb `O(x)` (with result
`O(x^2)`), and `3*x^5` is able to absorb `-2*x^5` (with result
`x^5`). Essentially, absorption can be interpreted as the
addition of "compatible" terms (partial addition).

.. TODO::

    - Implementation of more term types (e.g. `L` terms,
      `\Omega` terms, `o` terms, `\Theta` terms).

        We want to show step by step which terms can be absorbed

        Absorb the asymptotic term ``other`` and returns the resulting

        INPUT:

        - ``other`` -- an asymptotic term.

        - ``check`` -- a boolean. If ``check`` is ``True`` (default),
          then ``can_absorb`` is called before absorption.

        OUTPUT:

        An asymptotic term or ``None`` if a cancellation occurs. If no
        absorption can be performed, an :class:`ArithmeticError` is
        raised.

        .. NOTE::

            For a more detailed explanation of the *absorption* of
            asymptotic terms see the introduction of :mod:`this module
            <sage.monoids.asymptotic_term_monoid>`, or the examples
            below.

        EXAMPLES:

        We want to demonstrate in which cases an asymptotic term
        is able to absorb another term, as well as explain the output
        of this operation. We start by defining some parents and
        elements::

            sage: import sage.monoids.asymptotic_term_monoid as atm
            sage: import sage.groups.asymptotic_growth_group as agg
            sage: MG_QQ = agg.MonomialGrowthGroup(QQ, 'x'); x = MG_QQ.gen()
            sage: OT = atm.OTermMonoid(MG_QQ)
            sage: ET = atm.ExactTermMonoid(growth_group=MG_QQ, base_ring=QQ)
            sage: ot1, ot2 = OT(x), OT(x^2)
            sage: et1, et2 = ET(x, 100), ET(x^2, 2)
            sage: et3, et4 = ET(x^2, 1), ET(x^2, -2)

        Because of the definition of `O`-terms (see
        :wikipedia:`Big_O_notation`), they are able to absorb all
        other asymptotic terms with weaker or equal growth. The
        result of the absorption is the original `O` Term::

            sage: ot1.absorb(ot1)
            O(x)
            sage: ot1.absorb(et1)
            O(x)
            sage: ot1.absorb(et1) is ot1
            True

        The first example above corresponds to `O(x) + O(x) = O(x)`, and
        the second to `O(x) + 100x = O(x)`.
        If absorb is called on a term that cannot be absorbed, an
        ``ArithmeticError`` is raised::

            sage: ot1.absorb(ot2)
            Traceback (most recent call last):
            ...
            ArithmeticError: O(x) cannot absorb O(x^2)

        This would only work the other way around::

            sage: ot2.absorb(ot1)
            O(x^2)

        :class:`ExactTerm` is able to absorb another
        :class:`ExactTerm` if the terms have the same growth. In this
        case, *absorption* is nothing else than an addition of the
        respective coefficients::

            sage: et2.absorb(et3)
            3*x^2
            sage: et3.absorb(et2)
            3*x^2
            sage: et3.absorb(et4)
            -1*x^2

        Note that, for technical reasons, the coefficient `0` is not
        allowed, and thus ``None`` is returned if two exact terms
        cancel each other out::

            sage: et2.absorb(et4)
            sage: et4.absorb(et2) is None
            True

        TESTS:

        When disabling the ``check`` flag, absorb might produce
        wrong results::

            sage: et1.absorb(ot2, check=False)
            O(x)

            or :meth:`ExactTerm._absorb_`.
            Override this in derived class.

        EXAMPLES:

        EXAMPLES:

        First, we define some asymptotic terms (and their parents)::

            (5*x^2, 2/7*x^3)

        In order for the comparison to work, the terms have come from
        or coerce into the same parent. Concretely, comparing
        :class:`GenericTerm` to, for example, an :class:`OTerm`
        always yields ``False``::

            sage: g1 <= g2
            True
            sage: o1, g1
            (O(1/x), Generic Term with growth x)
            sage: o1 <= g1

        If the elements of the common parent do not possess
        coefficients, then only the growth is compared::

            True
            sage: o1 <= t1 and t1 <= o2
            True

        For terms with coefficient (like exact terms), the
        coefficient is compared as well if the growth is equal::

            True

class ExactTerm(TermWithCoefficient):
    r"""
    Class for asymptotic exact terms. These terms primarily consist of
    an asymptotic growth element as well as a coefficient specifying
    the growth of the asymptotic term.

    INPUT:

    - ``parent`` -- the parent of the asymptotic term.

    - ``growth`` -- an asymptotic growth element from
      ``parent.growth_group()``.

    - ``coefficient`` -- an element from ``parent.base_ring``.

    OUTPUT:

    An asymptotic exact term.

    EXAMPLES::

        sage: import sage.monoids.asymptotic_term_monoid as atm
        sage: import sage.groups.asymptotic_growth_group as agg
        sage: MG = agg.MonomialGrowthGroup(ZZ, 'x'); x = MG.gen()
        sage: ET = atm.ExactTermMonoid(MG, QQ)

    Asymptotic exact terms may be multiplied (with the usual rules
    applying)::

        sage: ET(x^2, 3) * ET(x, -1)
        -3*x^3
        sage: ET(x^0, 4) * ET(x^5, 2)
        8*x^5

    They may also be multiplied with `O` terms::

        sage: OT = atm.OTermMonoid(MG)
        sage: ET(x^2, 42) * OT(x)
        O(x^3)

    Absorption for asymptotic exact terms relates to addition::

        sage: ET(x^2, 5).can_absorb(ET(x^5, 12))
        False
        sage: ET(x^2, 5).can_absorb(ET(x^2, 1))
        True
        sage: ET(x^2, 5).absorb(ET(x^2, 1))
        6*x^2

    Note that, as for technical reasons, `0` is not allowed as a
    coefficient for an asymptotic term with coefficient, ``None``
    is returned if two asymptotic exact terms cancel out each other
    during absorption::

        sage: ET(x^2, 42).can_absorb(ET(x^2, -42))
        True
        sage: ET(x^2, 42).absorb(ET(x^2, -42)) is None
        True

    Exact terms can also be created by converting monomials with
    coefficient from the symbolic ring, or a suitable polynomial
    or power series ring::

        sage: x = var('x'); x.parent()
        Symbolic Ring
        sage: ET(5*x^2)
        5*x^2
        sage: x = ZZ['x'].gen(); x.parent()
        Univariate Polynomial Ring in x over Integer Ring
        sage: ET(5*x^2)
        5*x^2
        sage: x = ZZ[['x']].gen(); x.parent()
        Power Series Ring in x over Integer Ring
        sage: ET(5*x^2)
        5*x^2

        OUTPUT:

        A boolean.

        .. NOTE::

            For :class:`ExactTerm`, absorption corresponds to
            addition. This means that an exact term can absorb
            only other exact terms with the same growth.

        .. NOTE::

            In the context of exact terms, absorption translates
            to addition. As the coefficient `0` is not allowed,
            ``None`` is returned if the terms cancel out.

            sage: MG = agg.MonomialGrowthGroup(ZZ, 'x'); x = MG.gen()
            sage: ET = atm.ExactTermMonoid(MG, QQ)

        Asymptotic exact terms can absorb other asymptotic exact
        terms with the same growth::

            sage: et1, et2 = ET(x^2, 2), ET(x^2, -2)
