    Genus_Symbol_p_adic_ring() class in the quadratic_forms/genera
    subfolder) to be a list of tuples (one for each Jordan component
    p^m*A at p, where A is a unimodular symmetric matrix with
    coefficients the p-adic integers) of the following form:

        1. If p>2 then return triples of the form [`m`, `n`, `d`] where

            `m` = valuation of the component
