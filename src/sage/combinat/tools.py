def transitive_ideal(f, x):
    r"""
    Return a list of all elements reachable from `x` in the abstract
    reduction system whose reduction relation is given by the function
    `f`.

    In more elementary terms:

    If `S` is a set, and `f` is a function sending every element of `S`
    to a list of elements of `S`, then we can define a digraph on the
    vertex set `S` by drawing an edge from `s` to `t` for every
    `s \in S` and every `t \in f(s)`.

    If `x \in S`, then an element `y \in S` is said to be reachable
    from `x` if there is a path `x \to y` in this graph.

    Given `f` and `x`, this method computes the list of all elements of
    `S` reachable from `x`.

    Note that if there are infinitely many such elements, then this
    method will never halt.

    For more powerful versions, see :mod:`sage.combinat.backtrack`

    EXAMPLES::

        sage: f = lambda x: [x-1] if x > 0 else []
        sage: sage.combinat.tools.transitive_ideal(f, 10)
        [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
