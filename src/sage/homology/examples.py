Examples of simplicial complexes

This file constructs some examples of simplicial complexes.  There are
two main types: manifolds and examples related to graph theory.

For manifolds, there are functions defining the `n`-sphere for any
`n`, the torus, `n`-dimensional real projective space for any `n`, the
complex projective plane, surfaces of arbitrary genus, and some other
manifolds, all as simplicial complexes.

Aside from surfaces, this file also provides some functions for
constructing some other simplicial complexes: the simplicial complex
of not-`i`-connected graphs on `n` vertices, the matching complex on n
vertices, and the chessboard complex for an `n` by `i` chessboard.
These provide examples of large simplicial complexes; for example,
``simplicial_complexes.NotIConnectedGraphs(7,2)`` has over a million
simplices.

All of these examples are accessible by typing
``simplicial_complexes.NAME``, where ``NAME`` is the name of the example.
You can get a list by typing ``simplicial_complexes.`` and hitting the
TAB key::

    maximal with respect to inclusion of subsets of `A \times B`.

        Returns a pure simplicial complex of dimension 8 with 490 facets.

        .. WARNING::

            This is expected to be a triangulation of the projective plane
            `HP^2` over the ring of quaternions, but this has not been
            proved yet.

        This simplicial complex has the same homology as `HP^2`. Its
        automorphism group is isomorphic to the alternating group `A_5`
        and acts transitively on vertices.

        This is defined here using the description in [BrK92]_. This
        article deals with three different triangulations. This procedure
        returns the only one which has a transitive group of
        automorphisms.

    def RealProjectiveSpace(self, n):
        r"""
        A triangulation of `\Bold{R}P^n` for any `n \geq 0`.

        INPUT:

        - ``n`` -- integer, the dimension of the real projective space
          to construct

        The first few cases are pretty trivial:

        - `\Bold{R}P^0` is a point.

        - `\Bold{R}P^1` is a circle, triangulated as the boundary of a
          single 2-simplex.

        - `\Bold{R}P^2` is the real projective plane, here given its
          minimal triangulation with 6 vertices, 15 edges, and 10
          triangles.

        - `\Bold{R}P^3`: any triangulation has at least 11 vertices by
          a result of Walkup [Wa1970]_; this function returns a
          triangulation with 11 vertices, as given by Lutz [Lu2005]_.

        - `\Bold{R}P^4`: any triangulation has at least 16 vertices by
          a result of Walkup; this function returns a triangulation
          with 16 vertices as given by Lutz; see also Datta [Da2007]_,
          Example 3.12.

        - `\Bold{R}P^n`: Lutz has found a triangulation of
          `\Bold{R}P^5` with 24 vertices, but it does not seem to have
          been published.  Kühnel [Ku1987]_ has described a triangulation of
          `\Bold{R}P^n`, in general, with `2^{n+1}-1` vertices; see
          also Datta, Example 3.21.  This triangulation is presumably
          not minimal, but it seems to be the best in the published
          literature as of this writing.  So this function returns it
          when `n > 4`.

        ALGORITHM: For `n < 4`, these are constructed explicitly by
        listing the facets.  For `n = 4`, this is constructed by
        specifying 16 vertices, two facets, and a certain subgroup `G`
        of the symmetric group `S_{16}`.  Then the set of all facets
        is the `G`-orbit of the two given facets.  This is implemented
        here by explicitly listing all of the facets; the facets
        can be computed by the function :func:`facets_for_RP4`, but
        running the function takes a few seconds.

        For `n > 4`, the construction is as follows: let `S` denote
        the simplicial complex structure on the `n`-sphere given by
        the first barycentric subdivision of the boundary of an
        `(n+1)`-simplex.  This has a simplicial antipodal action: if
        `V` denotes the vertices in the boundary of the simplex, then
        the vertices in its barycentric subdivision `S` correspond to
        nonempty proper subsets `U` of `V`, and the antipodal action
        sends any subset `U` to its complement.  One can show that
        modding out by this action results in a triangulation for
        `\Bold{R}P^n`.  To find the facets in this triangulation, find
        the facets in `S`.  These are indentified in pairs to form
        `\Bold{R}P^n`, so choose a representative from each pair: for
        each facet in `S`, replace any vertex in `S` containing 0 with
        its complement.

        Of course these complexes increase in size pretty quickly as
        `n` increases.

        This is a pure simplicial complex of dimension 4 with 16 vertices

        This simplicial complex is implemented just by listing all 288
        facets. The list of facets can be computed by the function
        :func:`facets_for_K3`, but running the function takes a few
        seconds.

        vertices.  View each graph as its set of edges, so it is a
        subset of a set of size `n` choose 2.  A graph is
        `i`-connected if, for any `j<i`, if any `j` vertices are
        removed along with the edges emanating from them, then the

        is not `i`-connected, then the same is true for any graph
        obtained from `G` by deleting edges. Thus the set of all
        graphs which are not `i`-connected, viewed as a set of subsets

        A random `d`-dimensional simplicial complex on `n` vertices,
        as defined for example by Meshulam and Wallach [MW2009]_, is
        constructed as follows: take `n` vertices and include all of
        the simplices of dimension strictly less than `d`, and then for each
        possible simplex of dimension `d`, include it with probability `p`.

        The sum complexes of Linial, Meshulam, and Rosenthal [LMR2010]_.

        If `k+1` is the cardinality of `A`, then this returns a
        `k`-dimensional simplicial complex `X_A` with vertices
        `\ZZ/(n)`, and facets given by all `k+1`-tuples `(x_0, x_1,
        ..., x_k)` such that the sum `\sum x_i` is in `A`. See the
        paper by Linial, Meshulam, and Rosenthal [LMR2010]_, in which
        they prove various results about these complexes; for example,
        if `n` is prime, then `X_A` is rationally acyclic, and if in
        addition `A` forms an arithmetic progression in `\ZZ/(n)`,
        then `X_A` is `\ZZ`-acyclic. Throughout their paper, they
        assume that `n` and `k` are relatively prime, but the
        construction makes sense in general.

        In addition to the results from the cited paper, these
        complexes can have large torsion, given the number of
        vertices; for example, if `n=10`, and `A=\{0,1,2,3,6\}`, then
        `H_3(X_A)` is cyclic of order 2728, and there is a
        4-dimensional complex on 13 vertices with `H_3` having a
        cyclic summand of order
