Multifractal Random Walk

This module implements the fractal approach to understanding financial
markets that was pioneered by Mandelbrot.  In particular, it implements
the multifractal random walk model of asset returns as developed by
Bacry, Kozhemyak, and Muzy, 2006, *Continuous cascade models for asset
returns* and many other papers by Bacry et al. See
http://www.cmap.polytechnique.fr/~bacry/ftpPapers.html

See also Mandelbrot's *The Misbehavior of Markets* for a motivated
introduction to the general idea of using a self-similar approach to
modeling asset returns.

One of the main goals of this implementation is that everything is
highly optimized and ready for real world high performance simulation
work.

def stationary_gaussian_simulation(s, N, n=1):
    r"""
    Implementation of the Davies-Harte algorithm which given an
    autocovariance sequence (ACVS) ``s`` and an integer ``N``, simulates ``N``
    steps of the corresponding stationary Gaussian process with mean
    0. We assume that a certain Fourier transform associated to ``s`` is
    nonnegative; if it isn't, this algorithm fails with a
    ``NotImplementedError``.

    INPUT:

    - ``s`` -- a list of real numbers that defines the ACVS.
      Optimally ``s`` should have length ``N+1``; if not
      we pad it with extra 0's until it has length ``N+1``.

    - ``N`` -- a positive integer.

    OUTPUT:

    A list of ``n`` time series.

    EXAMPLES:

    We define an autocovariance sequence::

        sage: N = 2^15
        sage: s = [1/math.sqrt(k+1) for k in [0..N]]
        sage: s[:5]
        [1.0, 0.7071067811865475, 0.5773502691896258, 0.5, 0.4472135954999579]

    We run the simulation::

        sage: set_random_seed(0)
        sage: sim = finance.stationary_gaussian_simulation(s, N)[0]
        doctest:warning...
        DeprecationWarning: the package sage.finance is deprecated...

    Note that indeed the autocovariance sequence approximates ``s`` well::

        sage: [sim.autocovariance(i) for i in [0..4]]
        [0.98665816086255..., 0.69201577095377..., 0.56234006792017..., 0.48647965409871..., 0.43667043322102...]

    .. WARNING::

        If you were to do the above computation with a small
        value of ``N``, then the autocovariance sequence would not approximate
        ``s`` very well.

    REFERENCES:

    This is a standard algorithm that is described in several papers.
    It is summarized nicely with many applications at the beginning of
    *Simulating a Class of Stationary Gaussian Processes Using the
    Davies-Harte Algorithm, with Application to Long Memory
    Processes*, 2000, Peter F. Craigmile, which is easily found as a
    free PDF via a Google search.  This paper also generalizes the
    algorithm to the case when all elements of ``s`` are nonpositive.

    The book *Wavelet Methods for Time Series Analysis* by Percival
    and Walden also describes this algorithm, but has a typo in that
    they put a `2\pi` instead of `\pi` a certain sum.  That book describes
    exactly how to use Fourier transform.  The description is in
    Section 7.8.  Note that these pages are missing from the Google
    Books version of the book, but are in the Amazon.com preview of
    the book.
