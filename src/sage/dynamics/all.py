"""
Some code about flat surfaces and interval exchanges has been removed
from Sage. The package ``surface_dynamics`` contains all that code
and much more. For more information, see

    https://www.labri.fr/perso/vdelecro/surface-dynamics/latest/

You can install the ``surface_dynamics`` package via:

    sage -pip install surface_dynamics

If you do not have write access to the Sage installation you can
alternatively do:

    sage -pip install surface_dynamics --user
