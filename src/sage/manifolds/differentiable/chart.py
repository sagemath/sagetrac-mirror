Coordinate Charts on Differentiable Manifolds

The class :class:`DiffChart` implements coordinate charts on a differentiable
manifold over a topological field `K` (in most applications, `K = \RR` or
`K = \CC`).

The subclass :class:`RealDiffChart` is devoted
to the case `K=\RR`, for which the concept of coordinate range is meaningful.
Moreover, :class:`RealDiffChart` is endowed with some plotting
capabilities (cf. method :meth:`~sage.manifolds.chart.RealChart.plot`).

Transition maps between charts are implemented via the class
:class:`DiffCoordChange`.

class DiffChart(Chart):
    r"""
    Chart on a differentiable manifold.

    Given a differentiable manifold `M` of dimension `n` over a topological
    field `K`, a *chart* is a member `(U,\varphi)` of the manifold's
    differentiable atlas; `U` is then an open subset of `M` and
    `\varphi: U \rightarrow V \subset K^n` is a homeomorphism from
    `U` to an open subset `V` of `K^n`.

    The components `(x^1,\ldots,x^n)` of `\varphi`, defined by
    `\varphi(p) = (x^1(p),\ldots,x^n(p))\in K^n` for any point `p\in U`, are
    called the *coordinates* of the chart `(U,\varphi)`.

    INPUT:

    - ``domain`` -- open subset `U` on which the chart is defined
    - ``coordinates`` -- (default: '' (empty string)) single string defining
      the coordinate symbols, with ' ' (whitespace) as a separator; each item
      has at most two fields, separated by ':':

        1. The coordinate symbol (a letter or a few letters)
        2. (optional) The LaTeX spelling of the coordinate; if not provided the
           coordinate symbol given in the first field will be used.

      If it contains any LaTeX expression, the string ``coordinates`` must be
      declared with the prefix 'r' (for "raw") to allow for a proper treatment
      of LaTeX's backslash character (see examples below).
      If no LaTeX spelling is to be set for any coordinate, the argument
      ``coordinates`` can be omitted when the shortcut operator ``<,>`` is
      used via Sage preparser (see examples below)
    - ``names`` -- (default: ``None``) unused argument, except if
      ``coordinates`` is not provided; it must then be a tuple containing
      the coordinate symbols (this is guaranteed if the shortcut operator
      ``<,>`` is used).

    EXAMPLES:

    A chart on a complex 2-dimensional differentiable manifold::

        sage: M = Manifold(2, 'M', field='complex')
        sage: X = M.chart('x y'); X
        Chart (M, (x, y))
        sage: latex(X)
        \left(M,(x, y)\right)
        sage: type(X)
        <class 'sage.manifolds.differentiable.chart.DiffChart'>

    To manipulate the coordinates `(x,y)` as global variables, one has to set::

        sage: x,y = X[:]

    However, a shortcut is to use the declarator ``<x,y>`` in the left-hand
    side of the chart declaration (there is then no need to pass the string
    ``'x y'`` to ``chart()``)::

        sage: M = Manifold(2, 'M', field='complex')
        sage: X.<x,y> = M.chart(); X
        Chart (M, (x, y))

    The coordinates are then immediately accessible::

        sage: y
        y
        sage: x is X[0] and y is X[1]
        True

    The trick is performed by Sage preparser::

        sage: preparse("X.<x,y> = M.chart()")
        "X = M.chart(names=('x', 'y',)); (x, y,) = X._first_ngens(2)"

    Note that ``x`` and ``y`` declared in ``<x,y>`` are mere Python variable
    names and do not have to coincide with the coordinate symbols;
    for instance, one may write::

        sage: M = Manifold(2, 'M', field='complex')
        sage: X.<x1,y1> = M.chart('x y'); X
        Chart (M, (x, y))

    Then ``y`` is not known as a global Python variable and the
    coordinate `y` is accessible only through the global variable ``y1``::

        sage: y1
        y
        sage: latex(y1)
        y
        sage: y1 is X[1]
        True

    However, having the name of the Python variable coincide with the
    coordinate symbol is quite convenient; so it is recommended to declare::

        sage: M = Manifold(2, 'M', field='complex')
        sage: X.<x,y> = M.chart()

    In the above example, the chart X covers entirely the manifold M::

        sage: X.domain()
        2-dimensional complex manifold M

    Of course, one may declare a chart only on an open subset of M::

        sage: U = M.open_subset('U')
        sage: Y.<z1, z2> = U.chart(r'z1:\zeta_1 z2:\zeta_2'); Y
        Chart (U, (z1, z2))
        sage: Y.domain()
        Open subset U of the 2-dimensional complex manifold M

    In the above declaration, we have also specified some LaTeX writing
    of the coordinates different from the text one::

        sage: latex(z1)
        {\zeta_1}

    Note the prefix ``r`` in front of the string ``r'z1:\zeta_1 z2:\zeta_2'``;
    it makes sure that the backslash character is treated as an ordinary
    character, to be passed to the LaTeX interpreter.

    Coordinates are Sage symbolic variables (see
    :mod:`sage.symbolic.expression`)::

        sage: type(z1)
        <type 'sage.symbolic.expression.Expression'>

    In addition to the Python variable name provided in the operator ``<.,.>``,
    the coordinates are accessible by their indices::

        sage: Y[0], Y[1]
        (z1, z2)

    The index range is that declared during the creation of the manifold. By
    default, it starts at 0, but this can be changed via the parameter
    ``start_index``::

        sage: M1 = Manifold(2, 'M_1', field='complex', start_index=1)
        sage: Z.<u,v> = M1.chart()
        sage: Z[1], Z[2]
        (u, v)

    The full set of coordinates is obtained by means of the operator
    ``[:]``::

        sage: Y[:]
        (z1, z2)

    Each constructed chart is automatically added to the manifold's user
    atlas::

        sage: M.atlas()
        [Chart (M, (x, y)), Chart (U, (z1, z2))]

    and to the atlas of the chart's domain::

        sage: U.atlas()
        [Chart (U, (z1, z2))]

    Manifold subsets have a *default chart*, which, unless changed via the
    method
    :meth:`~sage.manifolds.manifold.TopologicalManifold.set_default_chart`,
    is the first defined chart on the subset (or on a open subset of it)::

        sage: M.default_chart()
        Chart (M, (x, y))
        sage: U.default_chart()
        Chart (U, (z1, z2))

    The default charts are not privileged charts on the manifold, but rather
    charts whose name can be skipped in the argument list of functions having
    an optional ``chart=`` argument.

    The action of the chart map `\varphi` on a point is obtained by means of
    the call operator, i.e. the operator ``()``::

        sage: p = M.point((1+i, 2), chart=X); p
        Point on the 2-dimensional complex manifold M
        sage: X(p)
        (I + 1, 2)
        sage: X(p) == p.coord(X)
        True

        `(U,\varphi)` on the open subset where the two charts intersect, i.e.
        on `U\cap V`.

        By definition, the transition map `\psi\circ\varphi^{-1}` must be
        of classe `C^k`, where `k` is the degree of differentiability of the
        manifold (cf.
        :meth:`~sage.manifolds.differentiable.manifold.DifferentiableManifold.diff_degree`).

          of the coordinates `(x^1,\ldots,x^n)`

          subset `U\cap V` if the latter differs from `U` or `V`

          coordinates of the current chart that define `U\cap V` if the
          latter differs from `U`. ``restrictions1`` must be a list of
          of symbolic equalities or inequalities involving the
          coordinates, such as x>y or x^2+y^2 != 0. The items of the list
          ``restrictions1`` are combined with the ``and`` operator; if some
          restrictions are to be combined with the ``or`` operator instead,
          they have to be passed as a tuple in some single item of the list
          ``restrictions1``. For example, ``restrictions1`` = [x>y,
          (x!=0, y!=0), z^2<x] means (x>y) and ((x!=0) or (y!=0)) and (z^2<x).
          If the list ``restrictions1`` contains only one item, this item can
          be passed as such, i.e. writing x>y instead of the single-element
          list [x>y].

          latter differs from `V` (see ``restrictions1`` for the syntax)

        OUTPUT:

        - The transition map `\psi\circ\varphi^{-1}` defined on `U\cap V`, as an
          instance of :class:`DiffCoordChange`.

    Chart on a differentiable manifold over `\RR`.

    Given a differentiable manifold `M` of dimension `n` over `\RR`,
    a *chart* is a member `(U,\varphi)` of the manifold's
    differentiable atlas; `U` is then an open subset of `M` and
    `\varphi: U \rightarrow V \subset \RR^n` is a homeomorphism from
    `U` to an open subset `V` of `\RR^n`.

    The components `(x^1,\ldots,x^n)` of `\varphi`, defined by
    `\varphi(p) = (x^1(p),\ldots,x^n(p))\in \RR^n` for any point `p\in U`, are
    called the *coordinates* of the chart `(U,\varphi)`.

    INPUT:

    - ``domain`` -- open subset `U` on which the chart is defined
    - ``coordinates`` -- (default: '' (empty string)) single string defining
      the coordinate symbols and ranges, with ' ' (whitespace) as a separator;
      each item has at most three fields, separated by ':':

        1. The coordinate symbol (a letter or a few letters)
        2. (optional) The interval `I` defining the coordinate range: if not
           provided, the coordinate is assumed to span all `\RR`; otherwise
           `I` must be provided in the form ``(a,b)`` (or equivalently
           ``]a,b[``). The bounds ``a`` and ``b`` can be ``+/-Infinity``,
           ``Inf``, ``infinity``, ``inf`` or ``oo``.
           For *singular* coordinates, non-open intervals such as ``[a,b]`` and
           ``(a,b]`` (or equivalently ``]a,b]``) are allowed.
           Note that the interval declaration must not contain any whitespace.
        3. (optional) The LaTeX spelling of the coordinate; if not provided the
           coordinate symbol given in the first field will be used.

      The order of the fields 2 and 3 does not matter and each of them can be
      omitted.
      If it contains any LaTeX expression, the string ``coordinates`` must be
      declared with the prefix 'r' (for "raw") to allow for a proper treatment
      of LaTeX backslash characters (see examples below).
      If no interval range and no LaTeX spelling is to be set for any
      coordinate, the argument ``coordinates`` can be omitted when the
      shortcut operator ``<,>`` is used via Sage preparser (see examples below)
    - ``names`` -- (default: ``None``) unused argument, except if
      ``coordinates`` is not provided; it must then be a tuple containing
      the coordinate symbols (this is guaranteed if the shortcut operator
      ``<,>`` is used).

    EXAMPLES:

    Cartesian coordinates on `\RR^3`::

        sage: M = Manifold(3, 'R^3', r'\RR^3', start_index=1)
        sage: c_cart = M.chart('x y z'); c_cart
        Chart (R^3, (x, y, z))
        sage: type(c_cart)
        <class 'sage.manifolds.differentiable.chart.RealDiffChart'>

    To have the coordinates accessible as global variables, one has to set::

        sage: (x,y,z) = c_cart[:]

    However, a shortcut is to use the declarator ``<x,y,z>`` in the left-hand
    side of the chart declaration (there is then no need to pass the string
    ``'x y z'`` to  ``chart()``)::

        sage: c_cart.<x,y,z> = M.chart(); c_cart
        Chart (R^3, (x, y, z))

    The coordinates are then immediately accessible::

        sage: y
        y
        sage: y is c_cart[2]
        True

    The trick is performed by Sage preparser::

        sage: preparse("c_cart.<x,y,z> = M.chart()")
        "c_cart = M.chart(names=('x', 'y', 'z',)); (x, y, z,) = c_cart._first_ngens(3)"

    Note that ``x, y, z`` declared in ``<x,y,z>`` are mere Python variable
    names and do not have to coincide with the coordinate symbols; for instance,
    one may write::

        sage: M = Manifold(3, 'R^3', r'\RR^3', start_index=1)
        sage: c_cart.<x1,y1,z1> = M.chart('x y z'); c_cart
        Chart (R^3, (x, y, z))

    Then ``y`` is not known as a global variable and the coordinate `y`
    is accessible only through the global variable ``y1``::

        sage: y1
        y
        sage: y1 is c_cart[2]
        True

    However, having the name of the Python variable coincide with the
    coordinate symbol is quite convenient; so it is recommended to declare::

        sage: forget()   # for doctests only
        sage: M = Manifold(3, 'R^3', r'\RR^3', start_index=1)
        sage: c_cart.<x,y,z> = M.chart()

    Spherical coordinates on the subset `U` of `\RR^3` that is the
    complement of the half-plane `\{y=0, x\geq 0\}`::

        sage: U = M.open_subset('U')
        sage: c_spher.<r,th,ph> = U.chart(r'r:(0,+oo) th:(0,pi):\theta ph:(0,2*pi):\phi')
        sage: c_spher
        Chart (U, (r, th, ph))

    Note the prefix 'r' for the string defining the coordinates in the
    arguments of ``chart``.

    Coordinates are Sage symbolic variables (see
    :mod:`sage.symbolic.expression`)::

        sage: type(th)
        <type 'sage.symbolic.expression.Expression'>
        sage: latex(th)
        {\theta}
        sage: assumptions(th)
        [th is real, th > 0, th < pi]

    Coordinate are also accessible by their indices::

        sage: x1 = c_spher[1]; x2 = c_spher[2]; x3 = c_spher[3]
        sage: [x1, x2, x3]
        [r, th, ph]
        sage: (x1, x2, x3) == (r, th, ph)
        True

    The full set of coordinates is obtained by means of the operator [:]::

        sage: c_cart[:]
        (x, y, z)
        sage: c_spher[:]
        (r, th, ph)

    Let us check that the declared coordinate ranges have been taken into
    account::

        sage: c_cart.coord_range()
        x: (-oo, +oo); y: (-oo, +oo); z: (-oo, +oo)
        sage: c_spher.coord_range()
        r: (0, +oo); th: (0, pi); ph: (0, 2*pi)
        sage: bool(th>0 and th<pi)
        True
        sage: assumptions()  # list all current symbolic assumptions
        [x is real, y is real, z is real, r is real, r > 0, th is real,
         th > 0, th < pi, ph is real, ph > 0, ph < 2*pi]

    The coordinate ranges are used for simplifications::

        sage: simplify(abs(r)) # r has been declared to lie in the interval (0,+oo)
        r
        sage: simplify(abs(x)) # no positive range has been declared for x
        abs(x)

    Each constructed chart is automatically added to the manifold's user atlas::

        sage: M.atlas()
        [Chart (R^3, (x, y, z)), Chart (U, (r, th, ph))]

    and to the atlas of its domain::

        sage: U.atlas()
        [Chart (U, (r, th, ph))]


    Manifold subsets have a *default chart*, which, unless changed via the
    method
    :meth:`~sage.manifolds.manifold.TopologicalManifold.set_default_chart`,
    is the first defined chart on the subset (or on a open subset of it)::

        sage: M.default_chart()
        Chart (R^3, (x, y, z))
        sage: U.default_chart()
        Chart (U, (r, th, ph))

    The default charts are not privileged charts on the manifold, but rather
    charts whose name can be skipped in the argument list of functions having
    an optional ``chart=`` argument.

    The action of the chart map `\varphi` on a point is obtained by means of
    the call operator, i.e. the operator ``()``::

        sage: p = M.point((1,0,-2)); p
        Point on the 3-dimensional differentiable manifold R^3
        sage: c_cart(p)
        (1, 0, -2)
        sage: c_cart(p) == p.coord(c_cart)
        True
        sage: q = M.point((2,pi/2,pi/3), chart=c_spher) # point defined by its spherical coordinates
        sage: c_spher(q)
        (2, 1/2*pi, 1/3*pi)
        sage: c_spher(q) == q.coord(c_spher)
        True
        sage: a = U.point((1,pi/2,pi)) # the default coordinates on U are the spherical ones
        sage: c_spher(a)
        (1, 1/2*pi, pi)
        sage: c_spher(a) == a.coord(c_spher)
        True

    Cartesian coordinates on `U` as an example of chart construction with
    coordinate restrictions: since `U` is the complement of the half-plane
    `\{y=0, x\geq 0\}`, we must have `y\not=0` or `x<0` on U. Accordingly,
    we set::

        sage: c_cartU.<x,y,z> = U.chart()
        sage: c_cartU.add_restrictions((y!=0, x<0)) # the tuple (y!=0, x<0) means y!=0 or x<0
        sage: # c_cartU.add_restrictions([y!=0, x<0]) would have meant y!=0 AND x<0
        sage: U.atlas()
        [Chart (U, (r, th, ph)), Chart (U, (x, y, z))]
        sage: M.atlas()
        [Chart (R^3, (x, y, z)), Chart (U, (r, th, ph)), Chart (U, (x, y, z))]
        sage: c_cartU.valid_coordinates(-1,0,2)
        True
        sage: c_cartU.valid_coordinates(1,0,2)
        False
        sage: c_cart.valid_coordinates(1,0,2)
        True

    Chart grids can be drawn in 2D or 3D graphics thanks to the method

class DiffCoordChange(CoordChange):
    r"""
    Transition map between two charts of a differentiable manifold.

    Giving two coordinate charts `(U,\varphi)` and `(V,\psi)` on a
    differentiable manifold `M` of dimension `n` over a topological field `K`,
    the *transition map from* `(U,\varphi)` *to* `(V,\psi)` is the map

    .. MATH::

        \psi\circ\varphi^{-1}: \varphi(U\cap V) \subset K^n
        \rightarrow \psi(U\cap V) \subset K^n,

    In other words, the transition map `\psi\circ\varphi^{-1}` expresses the
    coordinates `(y^1,\ldots,y^n)` of `(V,\psi)` in terms of the coordinates
    `(x^1,\ldots,x^n)` of `(U,\varphi)` on the open subset where the two
    charts intersect, i.e. on `U\cap V`.

    By definition, the transition map `\psi\circ\varphi^{-1}` must be
    of classe `C^k`, where `k` is the degree of differentiability of the
    manifold (cf.
    :meth:`~sage.manifolds.differentiable.manifold.DifferentiableManifold.diff_degree`).

    INPUT:

    - ``chart1`` -- chart `(U,\varphi)`
    - ``chart2`` -- chart `(V,\psi)`
    - ``transformations`` -- tuple (or list) `(Y_1,\ldots,Y_2)`, where
      `Y_i` is the symbolic expression of the coordinate `y^i` in terms
      of the coordinates `(x^1,\ldots,x^n)`

    EXAMPLES:

    Transition map on a 2-dimensional differentiable manifold::

        sage: M = Manifold(2, 'M')
        sage: X.<x,y> = M.chart()
