Abstract SAT Solver

All SAT solvers must inherit from this class.

.. note::

    Our SAT solver interfaces are 1-based, i.e., literals start at
    1. This is consistent with the popular DIMACS format for SAT
    solving but not with Pythion's 0-based convention. However, this
    also allows to construct clauses using simple integers.

        Reads DIMAC files.

        Reads in DIMAC formatted lines (lazily) from a
        file or file object and adds the corresponding
        clauses into this solver instance. Note that the
        DIMACS format is not well specified, see
        http://people.sc.fsu.edu/~jburkardt/data/cnf/cnf.html,

        The differences were summarized in the discussion on
        the ticket :trac:`16924`. This method assumes the following
        DIMACS format

        - Any line starting with "c" is a comment
        - Any line starting with "p" is a header
        - Any variable 1-n can be used
