    Used to compute the leading position of a vector v.

    INPUT:

     - `v` - vector

    OUTPUT:

    Outputs the leading position of a vector v, which is the position with highest degree. For multiple positions with equal degrees the highest position i, or rightmost in the vector, is chosen.

        This method is used in the mulders-storjohann algorithm.

cdef simple_transformation(M,rowtochange,basisrow,LP):
    r"""
    Function to compute a simple transformation on a matrix.

    INPUT:

     - `M` - Matrix to operate on.
     
     - `rowtochange` - Integer to indicate the row M[rowtochange] that 
     is to be changed.
     
     - `basisrow` - Integer to indicate the row M[basisrow] that is used 
     to change M[rowtochange].
     
     - `LP` - Position of the leading positions in the two vectors.

    OUTPUT:

        Transforms M[rowtochange] into M[rowtochange]-a*x^d*M[basisrow], wherby d is the difference of
        the degree of the leading positions and a is the division of the
        leading coefficients.
    
    .. WARNING::
    
        The degree of the leadingposition of rowtochange has to be greater or equal
        to the degree of the leadingposition of basisrow.

cpdef mulders_storjohann(M):
    r"""
    Function to transform M into weak popov form.

    INPUT:

     - `M` - Matrix.
     
    OUTPUT:

        M transformed into weak popov form.
    
    ALGORITHM::
    
        This function uses the mulders-storjohann algorithm of [MS].
        It works as follow:
        #. As long as M is not in weak popov form do:
            #. Find two rows with conflicting leading positions.
            #. Do a simple transformation:
                #. Let x and y be indicators of rows with identical leading position
                #. Let LP be the Leading Position and LC the Leading Coefficient
                #. let a = LP(M[x]).degree() - LP(M[y]).degree()
                #. let d = LC(LP(M[x])) / LC(LP(M[y]))
                #. substitute M[x] = M[x] - a * x^d * M[y]
