# This script protects all environment variables that start with "SECRET_".
# It puts them in a temporary file. The name of the variable contains the path
# of that file.  This filename can then safely be used in `cat` even if `set
# -x` has been turned on. Also you can run "export" to understand the
# environment without danger.
# Be careful, however, not to use this like the following:
# docker login $DOCKER_USER $(cat $SECRET_DOCKER_PASS)
# as this would expose the password if `set -x` has been turned on.
