# This script gets called from CI to pull the Sage docker images that were
# built during the "build" phase to pull all the connected docker daemon
# (likely a docker-in-docker.)
# This script expects a single parameter, the base name of the docker image
# such as sagemath or sagemath-dev.
# The variable $DOCKER_IMAGE is set to the full name of the pulled image;
# source this script to use it.
