# This file configures automatic builds of Sage on [CircleCI](https://circleci.com).
# To make the build time not too excessive, we seed the build cache with
# sagemath/sagemath-dev:develop. When basic SPKGs change, this does not help much,
# still the full build does usually not exceed CircleCI's limits for open
# source projcets (five hours on 2 vCPUs as of early 2018.)
# You might want to try to build locally or with GitLab CI, see
# `.gitlab-ci.yml` for more options.

# As of early 2018, a run on CircleCI takes usually about 25 minutes. Most of
# the time is spent pulling/pushing from/to Docker Hub and copying files
# locally during the docker build. We could probably save five minutes by not
# building and testing the sagemath-dev image for most branches.
