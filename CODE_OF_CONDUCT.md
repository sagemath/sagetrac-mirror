# Code of Conduct #

Approved by the Sage community by a vote which ended on November 24, 2014

The Sage community is comprised of an international mixture of mathematicians,
computer scientists, engineers, researchers, teachers, amateurs, and others
with varied backgrounds. This diversity is one of our strengths, but it can
also lead to communication problems and unhappiness. People who love working on
Sage can more effectively collaborate with others if they follow this code.

1. Be friendly and patient.

2. Be welcoming. We strive to be a community that welcomes and supports people
   of all backgrounds and identities.

3. Be considerate. Your work will be used by other people and you in turn will
   depend on the work of others. Any decision you take will affect users and
   developers, so you should take those consequences into account when making
   decisions. Conversely, Sage is constantly evolving, and earlier decisions
   that were made in good faith may sometimes need to be reconsidered.
   Nonetheless, we should still appreciate the hard work done in the past.

4. Be respectful and polite. Not all of us will agree all the time, but
   disagreement is no excuse for poor behavior and poor manners. We might all
   experience some frustration now and then, but we cannot allow that
   frustration to morph into personal attacks. It is important to remember that
   a community where people feel uncomfortable or threatened is not a
   productive one. Members of the Sage community should be respectful when
   dealing with other developers and users.

   When we disagree, we should try to understand why. Disagreements, both
   social and technical, happen all the time. It is important that we resolve
   disagreements and differing views constructively. Being unable to understand
   why someone holds a viewpoint does not mean that they are wrong. Do not
   forget that it is human to err. Blame alone gets us nowhere, it is better to
   help resolve issues so we can all learn from our mistakes.

If you believe someone is violating the code of conduct, we ask that you report
it to https://groups.google.com/g/sage-abuse. The group administrators will
consider the issue and explore resolutions. It is also possible to move heated
discussions to https://groups.google.com/g/sage-flame.
