== Special Update/Build Instructions ==

csdp is an autotool'ed version of CSDP, see https://projects.coin-or.org/Csdp,
developed in its own repository at http://github.org/dimpase/csdp.

To update to a new version, you need to bump the version number in
configure.ac and rerun autotools (autoreconf -fiv).
Any changes should be merged to the upstream repo.

The build is done with NOSHORTS variable defined; this makes it compatible
with packages, where NOSHORTS must be defined, e.g. 
https://github.com/dimpase/pycsdp; 
also the Sage Cython interface needs NOSHORTS defined.

Detailed steps to build the spkg are as follows. You need 
 * git
 * autotools and libtool (the full autohell suite, version at least 2.67)

With these ready:
 * ./spkg-src
 * copy the resulting csdp-<version>.tar.gz to SAGE_ROOT/upstream, 
   or somewhere else appropriate
