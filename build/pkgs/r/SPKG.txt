== Description ==
R is a language and environment for statistical computing and graphics.
It is a GNU project which is similar to the S language and environment
which was developed at Bell Laboratories (formerly AT&T, now Lucent
Technologies) by John Chambers and colleagues. R can be considered as a
different implementation of S. There are some important differences, but
much code written for S runs unaltered under R.

=== Patches ===
 * configure.patch: Use -### instead of -v to detect linker options.
   See Sage ticket #12787 and upstream ticket
   https://bugs.r-project.org/bugzilla3/show_bug.cgi?id=14865
   The corresponding patch to m4/clibs.m4 is not included, as
   autoconf-2.68 gives errors, even on the clean upstream sources.
 * R.sh.in: Set R_HOME_DIR to "${SAGE_LOCAL}/lib/R/" when running R.
 * scripts.Makefile.in.patch: the file src/src/scripts/R.sh.in
   defines R_SHARE_DIR, R_INCLUDE_DIR, and R_DOC_DIR relative to
   R_HOME_DIR, but scripts/Makefile.in hardcodes these
   locations. This patch removes this hardcoding. See Sage trac
   #9668.
 * large_address_aware.patch: don't pass --large-address-aware to ld on
   Cygwin64.
 * parent_sig_handler.patch: make sure the parent_sig_handler function is
   defined before getting used.
