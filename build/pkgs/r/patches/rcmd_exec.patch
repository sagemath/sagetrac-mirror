On Cygwin some of the scripts in $R_HOME/bin can fail to be recognized
as executable, because they do no contain a shebang line and, depending
on the ACL settings in the Cygwin mount, may not have an executable flag
either.  This results in the scripts not being run properly.  It's fine
to just check that they exist.  See https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/20655
