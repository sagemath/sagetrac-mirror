== Description ==

'patch' takes a patch file containing a difference listing produced
by the 'diff' program and applies those differences to one
or more original files, producing patched versions.

The version of 'patch' included is the GNU one. Some of the 'diff' files
produced by GNU 'diff' are not acceptble to some versions of the 'patch'
command, such as the 'patch' command that comes with Solaris.

None

== Special Update/Build Instructions ==

In the event patches ever need to be made to this package, the method of
applying the patches should not rely on the 'patch' existing on the system.

Since bzip2 may (actually, does) depend on patch indirectly the patch
tarball must be in gzip format.
