== Description ==

ThebeLab is a small JavaScript library built on top of JupyterLab that
makes the code cells embedded in a static HTML page editable and
executable. It's a more sustainable reimplementation of the Thebe
library Sage was previously using.

This is used by Sage's Sphinx documentation build system to produce
html documentation that can be turned live. See:
