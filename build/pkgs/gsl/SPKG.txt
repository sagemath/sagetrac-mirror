== Description ==

Website: http://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/

From the website above: The GNU Scientific Library (GSL) is a numerical
library for C and C++ programmers. It is free software under the GNU General
Public License.

The library provides a wide range of mathematical routines such as random
number generators, special functions and least-squares fitting. There are
over 1000 functions in total with an extensive test suite. If the variable
SAGE_CHECK is exported to the value "yes" when building Sage, GSL's test suite
is run.

GSL mailing lists:

 * Bug-gsl <bug-gsl@gnu.org> mailing list -- bug reports for the GNU
   Scientific Library should be sent to bug-gsl@gnu.org
 * Help-gsl <help-gsl@gnu.org> users mailing list -- for questions about
   installation, how GSL works and how it is used, or general questions
   concerning GSL.
 * Info-gsl <info-gsl@gnu.org> mailing list -- announcements of new releases
   are made there.

== Dependencies ==

 * None - GSL does not depend on any other Sage package to compile, link
   and pass all of GSL's self-tests. Despite that fact, BLAS is listed as
   a dependency. (It comes with its own CBLAS implementation that is e.g.
   used when running the GSL test suite during installation; however, the
   Sage library only uses it as a fall-back, if e.g. BLAS library is not
   present.)
