== Description ==

This project converts between a standalone reStructuredText file and a
Jupyter Notebook file.

This is currently achieved by converting to markdown with pandoc and then
to Jupyter notebook using notedown, plus some configuration and tweaks.

We use a fork that is adapted for Sage.

There are no release numbers, hence find the latest commit, download
https://github.com/nthiery/rst-to-ipynb/archive/${COMMIT}.zip and rename
it rst_to_ipynb-${COMMIT:0:8}.zip

As it is written in Haskell, pandoc must be installed from the distro.
