== Description ==

surf is a tool to visualize some real algebraic geometry: plane algebraic
curves, algebraic surfaces and hyperplane sections of surfaces. surf is script
driven and has (optionally) a nifty GUI using the Gtk widget set.

This is used by the Singular Jupyter kernel to produce 3D plots.
