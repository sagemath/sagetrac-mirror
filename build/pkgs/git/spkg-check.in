# Do not run a test suite: see https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/30093.

# - The test suite takes a long time and can often fail in minor ways.
# - If some major aspect of git fails, it only affects the build
#   process of Sage, not the mathematical correctness of its results.
# - If some minor aspect of git fails, it won't affect anything about Sage.
