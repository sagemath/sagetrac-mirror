#-> Mac and Linux behave differently according to the presence of librt, and a
#   good way around if to make the computer believe that it does not exist
#   locally, or more precisely that it does not contain the clock_gettime
#   function. Cbc uses an alternative method to do the job, and it looks like
#   all this is required when Cbc solves LP with several threads.
