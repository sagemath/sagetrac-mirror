== Description ==

The Computational Infrastructure for Operations Research (COIN-OR**,
or simply COIN)  project is an initiative to spur the development of
open-source software for the operations research community.

The COIN Branch and Cut solver (CBC) is an open-source
mixed-integer program (MIP) solver written in C++. CBC is intended to
be used primarily as a callable library to create customized
branch-and-cut solvers. A basic, stand-alone executable version is
also available. CBC is an active open-source project led by John
Forrest at www.coin-or.org.
