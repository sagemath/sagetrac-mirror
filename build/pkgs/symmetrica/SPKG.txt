= symmetrica =

== Description ==

Symmetrica is a program developed by Lehrstuhl Mathematik II of the
University of Bayreuth. It has routines to handle the following topics

 * ordinary representation theory of the symmetric group and related groups (2/11/04)
 * ordinary representation theory of the classical groups
 * modular representation theory of the symmetric group
 * projective representation theory of the symmetric group
 * combinatorics of tableaux
 * symmetric functions and polynomials (7/22/04)
 * commutative and non commutative Schubert polynomials
 * operations of finite groups.
 * ordinary representation theory of Hecke algebras of type A_n

== Upstream Contact ==
 * Axel Kohnert - see http://www.mathe2.uni-bayreuth.de/axel/

== Dependencies ==
 * GNU patch (for applying the patches to upstream)

== Special Update/Build Instructions ==

The following patches are applied in spkg-install:

 * bruch.patch: store integers in a temporary variable before freeing memory
 * de.patch: turn off banner
 * int32.patch: use int32_t and uint32_t for type INT.
 * sort_sum_rename.patch: rename sort to sym_sort, sum to sym_sum
 * We copy over our own Makefile:
   patches/makefile (Fix compiler, i.e., use $CC, and let it use $CFLAGS.)

Permissions in the upstream tarball are funky, please run
"chmod 644 src/*" after unpacking.
