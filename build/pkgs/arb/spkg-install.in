# Trac #29607: We must always supply --with-gmp, --with-mpfr,
# --with-flint because otherwise ARB's configure script uses
# /usr/local, which is always wrong.
# This is why we do not use $SAGE_CONFIGURE_GMP etc. here.
# The value $SAGE_LOCAL is always a safe choice even if the library
# is coming from the system and is found using what is in
# LIBRARY_PATH or LDFLAGS etc.
