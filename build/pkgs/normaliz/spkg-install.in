# Disable features that require packages SCIP and CoCoA, both of which
# are experimental packages.

# FLINT is a standard package and E-ANTIC is an optional package.  We
# pass --enable-flint and --enable-enfnormaliz to configure so
# that an error will be signalled if FLINT or E-ANTIC cannot be found, rather
# than building normaliz without it.
