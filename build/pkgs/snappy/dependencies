$(PYTHON) decorator ipython cypari | $(PYTHON_TOOLCHAIN) sagelib

----------
All lines of this file are ignored except the first.

The dependency cypari above is actually cypari2.

An installed sagelib is needed when snappy is installed from source (instead of a wheel)
because snappy's setup.py tests its presence to adjust dependencies.
