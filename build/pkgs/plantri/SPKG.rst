plantri: Generate non-isomorphic sphere-embdedded graphs
========================================================

Description
-----------

Plantri is a program that generates certain types of graphs that are
imbedded on the sphere.

Exactly one member of each isomorphism class is output, using an amount
of memory almost independent of the number of graphs produced. This,
together with the exceptionally fast operation and careful validation,
makes the program suitable for processing very large numbers of graphs.

Isomorphisms are defined with respect to the embeddings, so in some
cases outputs may be isomorphic as abstract graphs.
