== Description ==

This code project provides a library for implementing graph algorithms as well
as implementations of several planarity-related graph algorithms. The origin of
this project is the reference implementation for the Edge Addition Planarity
Algorithm [1], which is now the fastest and simplest linear-time method for
planar graph embedding and planarity obstruction isolation (i.e. Kuratowski
subgraph isolation).

== Special Update/Build Instructions ==

The tarball was created from upstream's SVN repository by checking out
the version tag 2.2.0, see
http://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/18187#comment:48

Two changes were made to the upstream code:
- the non-free Nauty code in c/nauty was removed. Note that this
  requires adding a patch without_nauty.patch to remove planarity's
  bindings to Nauty.
- an autotools-based build system was added.
