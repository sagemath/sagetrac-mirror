== Description ==

Cephes Mathematical Library. Latest Linux distribution, dated
6/4/00. Special functions and other goodies in C, including long
double precision routines for 68K, 386, and sparc processors. This is
the most complete distribution package of the function library (but
not the most up-to-date one). It includes these sections-- double: all
functions in 64-bit double precision; single: all available functions
in 32-bit single precision; long double: all available functions in
80-bit extended precision; 128bit: all available functions in 128-bit
long double precision; qlib: all functions in q-type extended (44 to
106 decimal) precision, includes a C++ class for the binary floating
point arithmetic and a q-type calculator program; c9x-complex: new C
language standard C9X data type for complex variables, header
complex.h for GNU C and functions in float complex, double complex,
and long double complex precisions.

== Note ==

FreeBSD's math library does not have all the mathematics functions described in
Sections 7.3 and 7.12 of the C99 standard:
http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg14/www/docs/n1124.pdf
Specifically many of the complex and long double functions are missing in
FreeBSD.

Cephes provides those functions that are missing from FreeBSD.
The Makefiles have been modified so that it only adds the functions missing
from the version of FreeBSD in which compilation is taking place.
