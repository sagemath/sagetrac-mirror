sage_conf: Configuration module for the SageMath library
========================================================

Description
-----------

This package provides:

- a single Python module, ``sage_conf``, providing configuration information
  to the SageMath library at the time of its installation and at its runtime

- a console script ``sage-config``, for querying the variables of ``sage_conf``
  from the shell

- a sourcable shell script ``sage-env-config``, providing additional configuration
  information in the form of environment variables

This version of the package is generated by the Sage distribution's ``configure``
script.  Downstream packagers and advanced developers and users may want to provide
their own implementation of the package to support the intended deployment of
the SageMath library.
