== Changelog ==

=== libfplll-4.0.4 (Jean-Pierre Flori, 30 May 2013) ===
 * #12835: update to version 4.0.4.
 * Removed dpe.h patch which has been integrated upstream.

=== libfplll-3.0.12.p3 (Jean-Pierre Flori, 6 December 2012) ===

=== libfplll-3.0.12.p2 (Simon King, 10th December 2011) ===
 * #12131: Use --libdir, to make the package work on openSUSE.

=== libfplll-3.0.12.p1 (David Kirkby and Willem Jan Palenstijn, 14th July 2010) ===
 * #7864 "libfplll tries to link 64-bit objects to 32-bit libstdc++.so"
   Since setting CFLAGS and CXXFLAGS to include the compiler option -m64
   was not resulting in a successful 64-bit build of libfplll on OpenSolaris,
   another approach had to be taken. The changes redefined CC and CXX.
   For most users, the changes will set CC="gcc -m64", CXX="g++ -m64"
   if the environment variable SAGE64 is set to "yes", though neither
   the compilers nor the compiler option for building 64-bit binaries
   is hard-coded - they can be overridden by environment
   variables. The changes allow a 64-bit version of libfplll to be built
   on Solaris 10 on SPARC and OpenSolaris on x64.
 * #7738 Removed Michael Abshoff as a package maintainer, as he no longer works
   on the Sage project.
