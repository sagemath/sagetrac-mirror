## All sagelib-building is done by setup.py.
## This is so that sagelib can be installed by standard Python procedures,
## such as "./setup.py install" or "pip install ."
##
## We poison all environment variables that have paths to the sage source and build directories.
## In this way we make sure that all of the sagelib build's source paths are communicated through
## the current directory (for the source tree).
## Building takes places in the build/ subdirectory.
##
## As a special exception, we feed SAGE_PKGS and SAGE_SPKG_INST.
## They are needed by src/sage/misc/package.py.  See meta-ticket #28815 for planned changes to this.
