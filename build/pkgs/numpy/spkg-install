#
#  F77, F90, LDSHARED, LD, AR, RANLIB,
#  F77FLAGS, F90FLAGS, FREEFLAGS, FOPT, FARCH,
#  FDEBUG, FFLAGS, LDFLAGS, ARFLAGS
#
# then it will be used as is (even if empty),
# potentially omitting necessary flags.
# E.g., if LDFALGS is set, but does not contain "-shared",
# linking of shared modules will fail.
#
# So either we unset all of the above which can be harmful,
# or trust that the user won't break everything.
# The most critical parts are:
# - compile objects with -fPIC or equivalent,
# - link them with -shared.

# Make sure that the fortran objects are compiled with -fPIC
