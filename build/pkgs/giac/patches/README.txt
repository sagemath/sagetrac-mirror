*   the patch 1.1.1._index.h.patch has been merged in giac 1.1.2 (2014 08 01 version)
*   the nofltk is because giac is compiled without fltk, so some outputs differ 
    in the make check
*   the nopari files have to be applied when giac is compiled without pari, because 
    some outputs differ in the make check
