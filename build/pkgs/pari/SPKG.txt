== Description ==

PARI/GP is a widely used computer algebra system designed for fast
computations in number theory (factorizations, algebraic number
theory, elliptic curves...), but also contains a large number of other
useful functions to compute with mathematical entities such as
matrices, polynomials, power series, algebraic numbers etc., and a lot
of transcendental functions. PARI is also available as a C library to
allow for faster computations.

Originally developed by Henri Cohen and his co-workers (Universit√©
Bordeaux I, France), PARI is now under the GPL and maintained by Karim
Belabas with the help of many volunteer contributors.
