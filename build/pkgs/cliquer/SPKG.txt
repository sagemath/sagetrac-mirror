== Description ==
Cliquer is a set of C routines for finding cliques in an arbitrary
weighted graph. It uses an exact branch-and-bound algorithm recently
developed by Patr Ostergard.

== Dependencies ==
 * None

== Patches ==
 * Makefile.patch: Patch the Makefile for Sage. Remove hardcoded
   compiler and linker flags, allow flags to be set from spkg-install.
   More importantly, we're building cliquer as a dynamic shared library,
   instead of a stand-alone program.
