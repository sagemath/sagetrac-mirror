glucose: A SAT solver
=====================

Description
-----------

Glucose is a SAT solver.

Citing its website:

  The name of the solver is a contraction of the
  concept of "glue clauses", a particular kind of clauses that glucose
  detects and preserves during search. Glucose is heavily based on
  Minisat, so please do cite Minisat also if you want to cite Glucose.

   The parallel version of Glucose (all files modified since Glucose 3.0
   releases, 2013) cannot be used in any competitive event (sat
   competitions/evaluations) without the express permission of the
   authors
   (Gilles Audemard / Laurent Simon). This is also the case for any
   competitive
   event using Glucose Parallel as an embedded SAT engine (single core
   or not).
