== Description ==

A Package for Analyzing Lattice Polytopes (PALP) is a set of C
programs for calculations with lattice polytopes and applications to
toric geometry.

It contains routines for vertex and facet enumeration, computation of
incidences and symmetries, as well as completion of the set of lattice
points in the convex hull of a given set of points. In addition, there
are procedures specialised to reflexive polytopes such as the
enumeration of reflexive subpolytopes, and applications to toric
geometry and string theory, like the computation of Hodge data and
fibration structures for toric Calabi-Yau varieties.  The package is
well tested and optimised in speed as it was used for time consuming
tasks such as the classification of reflexive polyhedra in 4
dimensions and the creation and manipulation of very large lists of
5-dimensional polyhedra.

While originally intended for low-dimensional applications, the
algorithms work in any dimension and our key routine for vertex and
facet enumeration compares well with existing packages.

== License ==

 * When released, GPL 2 was in force.
 * There is a link to a web page, which now points to GPL 3, but would
   have pointed to GPL 2 at the time the package was released.
 * Therefore one can deduce the authors were happy for this to be
   released under GPL 2 or a later version.

== Change log ==

=== palp-2.1.p1 (Dima Pasechnik, 27 January 2013) ===
 * #13960: as proposed by J.-P. Flori; set the stack size to 8MB
   for Cygwin.

=== palp-2.1.p0 (Volker Braun, 4th June 2012) ===
 * #12088 Updated to the latest upstream version
 * Solaris sed does not understand character classes (:space:), dumb
   down even further
 * Removed the patched Polynf.c and MoriCone.c

=== palp-2.0.p2 (Volker Braun, 4th May 2012) ===
 * #12088 change regex in spkg-install from \s to [[:space:]], only
   the latter works on OSX

=== palp-2.0.p1 (R. Andrew Ohana, 26th February 2012) ===
 * #7071 Make spkg respect global CC and CFLAGS variables
 * made SAGE64 set the '-m64' flag the "proper" way

=== palp-2.0.p0 (Volker Braun, 19th November 2011) ===
 * #12055 Update to new upstream version
 * Now building multiple versions for different ambient dimensions
 * Patched Polynf.c and MoriCone.c that do not use nested functions
   (private communication with Harald Skarke)

=== palp-1.1.p3 (David Kirkby, 24th May 2010) ===
 * #9025 Add compiler option -m64 if the variable SAGE64 is set to
   "yes". The flag is added by 'sed'.

=== palp-1.1.p2 (Mitesh Patel, 12 Mar 2010) ===

 * #8477: Work around apparent GNU make problem when building spkgs in
    parallel.
 * SPKG.txt cleanup. The description is based on the abstract of this
   paper: http://arxiv.org/abs/math/0204356

=== palp-1.1.p1 (Tim Abbott, William Stein) ===

 * Debian packaging.  See 'hg log'.
 * Lost to history.
