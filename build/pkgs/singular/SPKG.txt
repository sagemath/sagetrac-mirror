== Description ==

Singular is a computer algebra system for polynomial computations,
with special emphasis on commutative and non-commutative algebra,
algebraic geometry, and singularity theory.

== License ==

GPLv2 or GPLv3

== Upstream Contact ==

libsingular-devel@mathematik.uni-kl.de

== Dependencies ==

* GNU patch
* readline
* GMP/MPIR
* MPFR
* NTL
* FLINT

== Special Update/Build Instructions ==

See spkg-src to create the source tarball.

Other notes:
 * If the environment variable SAGE_DEBUG is set to "yes", then
   omalloc will be replaced by xalloc. The resulting Singular executable
   and libsingular library will be slower than with omalloc, but allow
   for easier debugging of memory corruptions.

== Patches ==

singular-ntl-error-handler.patch: move NTL error handling out of libsingular so it doesn't conflict with Sage's
