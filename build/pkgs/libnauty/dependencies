----------
All lines of this file are ignored except the first.
It is copied by SAGE_ROOT/build/make/install into SAGE_ROOT/build/make/Makefile.

Adding the above instead of "nauty" makes sure that the dependency is not replaced
by ".dummy".  In this way, libnauty delegates building to nauty when
libnauty appears as a dependency (of normaliz).
