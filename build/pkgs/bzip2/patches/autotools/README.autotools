bzip2 autoconfiscated
=====================

Temporarily at http://ftp.suse.com/pub/people/sbrabec/bzip2/ expecting
that it will become a new upstream version to prevent per-distribution
shared library patching done by nearly each Linux vendor separately.

Autoconfiscation brings standard ./configure ; make ; make install
installation, seamless support of DESTDIR, automatic check for supported
CFLAGS, standard shared library support, automatic large files CFLAGS
check and all things that are supported by automake.

It makes obsolete Makefile-libbz2_so and README.COMPILATION.PROBLEMS.
Now configure should automatically detect correct build flags.

In case of any problem or question with autotools support feel free to
contact me: Stanislav Brabec <sbrabec@suse.cz>

Autoconfiscated version binaries are exactly equal to
bzip2-1.0.5.tar.gz. There are only few changes. See below.


New features:

Trivial link man pages for bzcat and bunzip2 added.

bzip2.pc file for pkg-config. Packages can use it for checks.


Incompatible changes:

soname change. Libtool has no support for two parts soname suffix (e. g.
libbz2.so.1.0). It must be a single number (e. g. libbz2.so.1). That is
why soname must change. But I see not a big problem with it. Several
distributions already use the new number instead of the non-standard
number from Makefile-libbz2_so.

To be super-safe, I incremented minor number of the library file, so
both instances of the shared library can live together.
