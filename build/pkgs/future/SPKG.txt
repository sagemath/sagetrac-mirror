Clean single-source support for Python 3 and 2

future is the missing compatibility layer between Python 2 and Python
3. It allows you to use a single, clean Python 3.x-compatible codebase
to support both Python 2 and Python 3 with minimal overhead.

It is designed to be used as follows:

from __future__ import (absolute_import, division,
                        print_function, unicode_literals)
from builtins import (
         bytes, dict, int, list, object, range, str,
         ascii, chr, hex, input, next, oct, open,
         pow, round, super,
         filter, map, zip)

followed by predominantly standard, idiomatic Python 3 code that then
runs similarly on Python 2.6/2.7 and Python 3.3+.

The imports have no effect on Python 3. On Python 2, they shadow the
corresponding builtins, which normally have different semantics on
Python 3 versus 2, to provide their Python 3 semantics.
