paganini: multiparametric tuner for combinatorial specifications
================================================================

Description
-----------

Paganini is a lightweight python library meant to help with the design of
combinatorial samplers. Given a combinatorial specification, expressed using a
domain-specific language closely resembling Flajolet and Sedgewick's *symbolic
method*, Paganini gives its users some additional control over the distribution
of structures constructed using the designed samplers.
