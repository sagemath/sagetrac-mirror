# Script to prepare a ECL tarball for Sage.  This script is only for the
# package maintainer, not for building ECL during a Sage install.
# WARNING: This script will delete/overwrite files in this directory
# and its subdirectories!
#
# HOW TO MAKE THE TARBALL:
# 1) copy upstream ecl-$ECLVERSION.tgz to this directory
# 2) ./spkg-src
# 3) compress ecl-$ECLVERSION into a .tar.bz2 file
