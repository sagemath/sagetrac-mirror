# Script to prepare a ECL tarball for Sage.  This script is only for the
# package maintainer, not for building ECL during a Sage install.
# WARNING: This script will delete/overwrite files in this directory
# and its subdirectories!
#
# HOW TO MAKE THE TARBALL:
# 1) copy upstream the tarball from gitlab; it will be named by the commit
# hash, e.g. ecl-a014bd2c23a9ba863ecdd28c1c48d67de04d3620.tar.gz
# Untar ECL tarball; the root dir will be named ecl.git/
# 2) ./spkg-src
#
# needs autotools and sage in your PATH.
