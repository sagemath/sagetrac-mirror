= TOPCOM =

== Description == 
TOPCOM is a collection of clients to compute Triangulations Of Point
Configurations and Oriented Matroids, resp. 

The algorithms use only combinatorial data of the point configuration
as is given by its oriented matroid. Some basic commands for computing
and manipulating oriented matroids can also be accessed by the user.

It was very much inspired by the maple program PUNTOS, which was
written by Jesus de Loera. TOPCOM is entirely written in C++, so there
is a significant speed up compared to PUNTOS.
