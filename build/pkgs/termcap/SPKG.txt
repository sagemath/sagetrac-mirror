   environment variable TERM is not set.
 * Restore upstream sources, put existing patch in
   patches/Makefile.in.patch
 * Use patch for patching
 * Standardize SPKG.txt

=== termcap-1.3.1.p1 (Jaap Spies, Jan 28th, 2010) ===
 * If $SAGE64="yes" add -m64 to CFLAGS. This used to work only on Darwin.
   This works now on Open Solaris x64 64 bit and may work on other 64 bit systems.
 * SPKG.txt needs more work!!!!! Not by me now.
 * This is trac http://trac.sagemath.org/sage_trac/ticket/8097

=== termcap-1.3.1.p0 (Michael Abshoff, May 18th, 2008) ===
 * add 64 OSX build support
 * check in all files
 * add .hgignore
 * Changes from upstream:
1) Deleted some lines from Makefile.in to prevent info docs being built

2) In Makefile.in I commented out the line

     oldincludedir = /usr/include

since SAGE install should work as not-root.
