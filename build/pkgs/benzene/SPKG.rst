benzene: Generate fusenes and benzenoids with a given number of faces
=====================================================================

Description
-----------

Benzene is a program for the efficient generation of all nonisomorphic
fusenes and benzenoids with a given number of faces. Fusenes are planar
polycyclic hydrocarbons with all bounded faces hexagons. Benzenoids are
