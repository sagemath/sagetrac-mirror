== Description ==

polymake is open source software for research in polyhedral

hypersurfaces, and other objects. Supported platforms

== Dependencies ==

Polymake needs a working installation of Perl, including its shared
library and some modules (XML::Writer XML::LibXML XML::LibXSLT).
These are not provided by a Sage package.  Sage does install the
Term::Readline::Gnu module, however, when you install polymake.

On Fedora 23, use:
 sudo yum install perl-ExtUtils-Embed

On Mac OS X, all modules appear to be standard.


Several Sage packages should be installed before installing the
polymake package to give a more featureful Polymake installation:
 sage -i latte_int 

Information on missing Polymake prerequisites after installing
polymake:
 $ sage -sh
 (sage-sh) $ polymake
