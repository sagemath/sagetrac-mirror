= Polymake =

== Description ==

polymake is open source software for research in polyhedral
geometry. It deals with polytopes, polyhedra and fans as
well as simplicial complexes, matroids, graphs, tropical
hypersurfaces, and other objects. Supported platforms
include various flavors of Linux, Free BSD and Mac OS.

== Dependencies ==

Polymake needs a working installation of Perl, including its shared
library and some modules (XML::Writer XML::LibXML XML::LibXSLT).
These are not provided by a Sage package.  Sage does install the
Term::Readline::Gnu module, however, when you install polymake.

On Ubuntu, use:
 sudo apt-get install libxml-libxslt-perl libxml-writer-perl libxml2-dev libperl-dev libncurses-dev

On Fedora 23, use:
 sudo yum install perl-ExtUtils-Embed

On Mac OS X, all modules (except for Term::Readline::Gnu) appear to be
standard.


Several Sage packages should be installed before installing the
polymake package to give a more featureful Polymake installation:
 sage -i 4ti2 latte_int topcom qhull

Software that would need to be installed manually (no Sage package
 available) for a more featureful Polymake installation:
 azove,
 porta,
 vinci,
 SplitsTree4

Information on missing Polymake prerequisites after installing
polymake:
 $ sage -sh
 (sage-sh) $ polymake
 polytope> show_unconfigured;

== Debugging polymake install problems ==

# apt-get install libdevel-trace-perl
$ cd src
$ perl -d:Trace support/configure.pl
