== Dependencies ==
 * iconv
 * GNU patch

== Special Update/Build Instructions ==
 * TODO:
   - Perhaps also modify CXXFLAGS (and/or CPPFLAGS).
   - We currently don't use anything of GMP's/MPIR's CC setting, and matching
     with the current compiler (`$CC`) is perhaps suboptimal.
 * Remove some files / directories not needed for Sage from upstream:
     rm -rf src/build.vc*             # Microsoft Visual C build files
     rm -rf src/yasm/Mkfiles/{dj,vc*} # DJGPP, Microsoft Visual C
   (Saves 13 of 40 MB uncompressed.)
