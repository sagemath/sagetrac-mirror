== Update Instructions ==

At the end of either method, copy `SAGE_DATA/cremona/cremona.db` to the src directory of the spkg.

=== Method 1 ===

If the cremona database has already been installed, remove
`SAGE_DATA/cremona/cremona.db`. Run

{{{
sage: sage.databases.cremona.build('cremona','path/to/ecdata.tgz')
}}}

=== Method 2 ===

Install the current version of the spkg, and copy the new files into a new
folder. Then run

{{{
sage: C = sage.databases.cremona.LargeCremonaDatabase('cremona',False)
sage: C._init_from_ftpdata('path/to/said/folder',0)
}}}

This method is much faster, but won't include any potential fixes old entries.
