=== freetype-2.5.2.p0 (Emmanuel Charpentier, December 21st 2013) ===
 * #15561: mindless drop-in-place of the current upstream source.
 * Added the license information in the present file.
 * Minor patch to libpng in order to work around a double setjmp setup.
 * buil/deps : freetype depends on libpng to work around a buildbot race condition.

=== freetype-2.3.5.p4 (Simon King, December 11th 2011) ===
 * #12131: Use --libdir, to make the package work on openSUSE

=== freetype-2.3.5.p3 (Mitesh Patel, October 21st 2010) ===
 * #9221, #9896: Increase the patch level to force reinstallation when
    upgrading to Sage 4.6.  This works around a problem with moved
    Sage installations.

=== freetype-2.3.5.p2 (David Kirkby, January 2nd 2010) ===
 * #7138 Ensure -m64 gets added on all platforms, not just OS X
   A better fix will be to remove all the hard-coded -m64 junk
   and replace by an environment variable CFLAG64, but until
   sage-env is updated, that will not work, so I've just left it
   as it has always been, but now working on all platforms if the
   compiler is gcc.
=== freetype-2.3.5.p1 (Mike Hansen, June 19th, 2009) ===
 * Applied Peter Jeremy's fix from #5866.

=== freetype-2.3.5.p0 (Michael Abshoff, May 18th, 2008) ===
