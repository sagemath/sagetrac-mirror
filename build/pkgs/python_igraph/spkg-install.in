# Use --use-pep517 because https://github.com/igraph/python-igraph as of 0.9.11 does not have pyproject.toml
# and so "pip wheel" would use a legacy build method, ignoring --config-settings.
#
# TODO: With setuptools 63.2.0, passing another --config-settings "--global-option=--no-wait" (not really needed)
# kills the "--global-option=--use-pkg-config".
# https://github.com/pypa/setuptools/issues/3380 makes changes to this, so we can revisit this after
# the next setuptools upgrade.
