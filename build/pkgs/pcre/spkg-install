# The JIT feature of pcre is known to be broken on some systems, in
# particular on Solaris. We run the testsuite of pcre (this takes only
# a few seconds). It the testsuite fails, we rebuild pcre without JIT
# support. See https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/24628
# We don't do this on Cygwin because the feature is already known to work there
# and the test suite doesn't pass on Cygwin otherwise, albeit for unrelated,
# mostly harmless reasons.
