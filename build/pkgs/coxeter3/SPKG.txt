== Special Update/Build Instructions ==

Upstream is unlikely to change, unless someone takes over the
development of Coxeter3. In any cases, the application of the
following patches is automatically handled by spkg-install:

- directories.h.patch: update coxeter3 directory information to fetch
  its data and messages from the Sage installation tree
- makefile.patch: handle compilation flags for Darwin and Cygwin
- sage.cpp: add a function for Bruhat invervals which is simpler to
  code in C++ than Cython

== Changelog ==

=== coxeter3-1.1 (Mike Hansen 2009-2013 + some fixes by Nicolas M. Thi√©ry and Jean-Pierre Flori) ===

 * Initial release. See Sage trac #12912
