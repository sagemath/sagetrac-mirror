== Description ==

Several "official" and "undeposited" GAP packages available from
http://www.gap-system.org/Packages/packages.html

== Upstream Contact ==

 * Dmitrii Pasechnik, dimpase@gmail.com
 * David Joyner, wdjoyner@gmail.com (on the GAP team)
 * Steve Linton, sal@dcs.st-and.ac.uk (basically the GAP lead developer)

== Dependencies ==

 * GAP (a standard spkg)

== TODO ==

The crystallographic group packages are untested/untestable. They rely
on polymake and the dependency "cryst" is missing. This needs to be
cleaned up.

== Notes ==

A brief description of each package follows:

braid is a GAP package for computing with braids, covering curves,
and Hurwitz spaces.
(Authors: K. Magaard, S. Shpectorov and H. Voelklein)

crime - package to compute the cohomology ring of finite
p-groups, induced maps, and Massey products.
(Author: Marcus Bishop)

cryst - Computing with crystallographic groups
(Authors: Bettina Eick, Franz Gähler, Werner Nickel)

CTblLib - The GAP Character Table Library
(Author: Thomas Breuer)

DESIGN is a package for classifying, partitioning and studying block designs.
(Author: Leonard H. Soicher)

FactInt is a package providing routines for factoring integers, in particular:
    * Pollard's p-1
    * Williams' p+1
    * Elliptic Curves Method (ECM)
    * Continued Fraction Algorithm (CFRAC)
    * Multiple Polynomial Quadratic Sieve (MPQS)
(Author: Stefan Kohl)

GAPDoc is a package containing a definition of a structure for
GAP documentation, based on XML. It also contains conversion
programs for producing text-, DVI-, PDF- or HTML-versions of such
documents, with hyperlinks if possible.
(Authors: Frank Luebeck, Max Neunhoeffer)

GRAPE is a package for computing with graphs and groups, and is primarily
designed for constructing and analysing graphs related to groups,
finite geometries, and designs.
(Author: Leonard H. Soicher)

GUAVA is included here, and with Sage standard.

HAP (Homological Algebra Programming) is a GAP package
providing some functions for group cohomology computation.
(Author: Graham Ellis)

HAPcryst - an extension package for HAP, which allows for
group cohomology computation for a wider class of groups.
(Author: Marc Roeder)

LAGUNA - this package provides functionality for calculation of the
normalized unit group of the modular group algebra of the finite
p-group and for investigation of Lie algebra associated with group
algebras and other associative algebras.
(Authors :Victor Bovdi, Alexander Konovalov, Richard Rossmanith,
Csaba Schneider)

polymake - an interface with the (standalone) polymake program
used by HAPcryst.
(Author: Marc Roeder)

SONATA ("System Of Nearrings And Their Applications") is a package
which constructs finite nearrings and related objects.
(Authors: Erhard Aichinger, Franz Binder, Jürgen Ecker, Peter Mayr,
Christof Noebauer)

TORIC is a GAP package for computing with toric varieties.
(Author: David Joyner)
