== Dependencies ==

No build-time dependencies.

The commandline jmol requires java at runtime.

== Special Build Instructions ==

To avoid depending on `unzip` at build time, we have to repack the tarball, see
`spkg-src`. We take the opportunity to remove some unnecessary subdirectories,
see http://wiki.jmol.org/index.php/Jmol_JavaScript_Object#In_detail
