# Copied from build/pkgs/flint/spkg-install.in:
#   Trac #29607: We must always supply --with-gmp, --with-mpfr,
#   --with-ntl because otherwise FLINT's configure script uses
#   /usr/local, which is always wrong.
#   This is why we do not use $SAGE_CONFIGURE_GMP etc. here.
#   The value $SAGE_LOCAL is always a safe choice even if the library
#   is coming from the system and is found using what is in
#   LIBRARY_PATH or LDFLAGS etc.
