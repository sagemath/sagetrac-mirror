== Description ==

From the Matplotlib website: matplotlib is a python 2D plotting
library which produces publication quality figures in a variety of
hardcopy formats and interactive environments across
platforms. matplotlib can be used in python scripts, the python and
ipython shell (ala matlab or mathematica), web application servers,
and six graphical user interface toolkits.

== License ==

The Matplotlib license - see
http://matplotlib.sourceforge.net/users/license.html: Matplotlib only
uses BSD compatible code, and its license is based on the PSF
license. See the Open Source Initiative licenses page for details on
individual licenses. Non-BSD compatible licenses (eg LGPL) are
acceptable in matplotlib Toolkits. For a discussion of the motivations
behind the licencing choice, see Licenses.

== Dependencies ==

 * python
 * numpy
 * setuptools (>= 0.7)
 * freetype
 * patch (used in spkg-install)
 * dateutil
 * pyparsing
 * tornado

== Build Instructions/Changes ==

 * NOTE: To drastically cut down on spkg size, we delete the internal
   testing images. To do this, we repackage the tarball by removing
   the contents of lib/matplotlib/tests/baseline_images/*, this is
   done by the spkg-src script.

 * setup.py.patch: disable loading of Tests. Otherwise, setup.py
   raises an error because it can't find the deleted files
   from src/lib/matplotlib/tests/baseline_images/*

 * NOTE: as of matplotlib-1.0.0 and Sage 4.6, Sage does not use
   $HOME/.matplotlib (or whatever the user has set in MPLCONFIGDIR).
   Instead, it sets MPLCONFIGDIR to $DOT_SAGE/matplotlib-VER, where
   VER is the matplotlib version number.  This is because of
   incompatibilities between the contents of .matplotlib between
   matplotlib versions 0.99.3 and 1.0.0.  Sage reads the version
   number VER by running

      python -c 'import matplotlib; print matplotlib.__version__'

   Note that at the end of the install process for matplotlib, the
   spkg-install file prints a message showing what MPLCONFIGDIR will
   be set to, using the command from sage-env, so this should provide
   a check.
