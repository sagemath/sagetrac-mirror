# For example, on Debian buster, the python3-minimal package does NOT provide it.

# from old homebrew installations.  Also check whether the current directory
# is accessible by this python; this is to guard on Cygwin against Pythons
# installed somewhere else in Windows.

# Trac #29285: Do not accept pythons that manipulate PATH, such as
# the shims provided by pyenv.

# operation in Python 3.0.x-3.6.x by setting LC_ALL=C or similar.
