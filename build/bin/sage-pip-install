# This command is specifically for pip-installing a previously
# built wheel.

# Default arguments for all packages installed with `pip install`
# --ignore-installed : Force pip to re-install package even if it thinks it's
#                      already installed (for which it sometimes gets false
#                      positives for partially-installed packages).
# --verbose          : Display the output when running setup.py.
# --no-deps          : Don't install runtime dependencies from PyPI.
# --no-index         : Don't look at the package index.
#                      This also disables pip's version self-check.
# --isolated         : Don't read configuration files such as
#                      ~/.pydistutils.cfg
pip_install_flags="--ignore-installed --verbose --no-deps --no-index --isolated"

# Note: "sage-pip-install" is meant to be run after $(PYTHON) has
# been installed (either as an spkg or as a venv over a system python3).
# It is then guaranteed by sage-env that PATH is set in a way that "python3"
# refers to the correct python3.
#
# All SPKGs that use this script must therefore declare $(PYTHON) as a
# dependency.
PYTHON=python3

# The PIP variable is only used to determine the name of the lock file.
PIP=pip3

# We should avoid running pip while installing a package because that
# is prone to race conditions. Therefore, we use a lockfile while
# running pip. This is implemented in the Python script sage-flock
LOCK="$SAGE_LOCAL/var/lock/$PIP.lock"

# Finally actually do the installation (the "SHARED" tells pip2/3-lock
# to apply a shared lock)
sage-flock -s $LOCK $PYTHON -m pip install $pip_install_flags "$@"

    echo >&2 "Error: installing with $PIP failed"
