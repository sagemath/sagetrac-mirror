# USAGE:
#
#     sage-flock [-s|-x] LOCKFILE COMMAND [...]
#
# Obtain an exclusive (-x, default) or shared (-s) lock on LOCKFILE and then
# exec COMMAND, with remaining arguments passed to COMMAND.
#
# This is originally motivated by pip, but has since been generalized.  We
# should avoid running pip while uninstalling a package because that is prone
# to race conditions. This script can be used to run pip under a lock.  For
# details, see https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/21672
