Levenshtein Distance

The Levenshtein distance between two words is the minimal number of
edits that turn one word into the other. Here, "edit" means a
single-letter addition, single-letter deletion, or exchange of a
letter with another letter.

EXAMPLES::

    >>> from sage_bootstrap.levenshtein import Levenshtein
    >>> Levenshtein(5)(u'Queensryche', u'Queensr√øche')
    1
